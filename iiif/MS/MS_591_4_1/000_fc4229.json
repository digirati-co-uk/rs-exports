I have on various occasions discussed with \r\nyou the procedure with regard to the rest of the material, \r\nwhich consists of about 1,000 double-folio sheets of observa-\r\ntions and maps of circum-polar  observations, and the records \r\nof the autographic instruments at he winter quarters. \r\nWith regard to the former, I have on various occasions \r\nsuggested to you, and I understand you to concur in the sugges-\r\ntion, that the maps should be reproduced on a very much reduced \r\nscale, at the rate of about 16 maps to the double page, showing \r\nthe salient features for each day. \r\nThe understanding was, that a sum should be assigned \r\nfor the issue of these maps with a few pages of explanatory \r\ntext, as a second volume of meteorological work. The sum \r\nmentioned was \u00a3250 to \u00a3300, but my grounds for mentioning these \r\nparticular figures do not amount to more than guess work. \r\nThe ground-work of each sheet, which would be printed \r\nin colour, would be the same for all; the line work, which \r\nwould have to be on a separate stone, would of course, be \r\ndifferent for each. \r\nCaptain Hepworth has been preparing a draft, and his \r\nview is, that we cannot get more than 12 maps on an opening. \r\nThe estimate required is therefore for 170 quarto pages of \r\ntwo-stone \r\nSir Archibald Geikie, D.C.L., Sc.D., L.L.D., \r\nThe Royal Society, \r\nBurlington House, W. \r\n",
