Any blame \r\nwhich he may imply is directed, not against the staff, but \r\nagainst the way in which it was selected and trained.\r\nWhen Dr. Shaw came to discuss the details of the work \r\nhe found them to be below the standard of fulness, precision and \r\naccuracy to which he is accustomed in the most advanced modern \r\n",
