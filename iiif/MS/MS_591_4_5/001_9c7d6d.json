What Instructions are referred to, by whom were \r\nthey drawn up, to whom were they communicated, and \r\nwhere may a copy now be found? \r\n2. What specially provided opportunity for 'practising \r\nthe working of the recording instruments beforehand' \r\nwas neglected and by whom? \r\n3. What changes of Staff are referred to? How did \r\nthese lead to the loss of instructions concerning, or \r\nopportunities for working the self recording instruments? \r\nI know of no special opportunities provided \r\nfor practising the working of the self recording \r\ninstruments though I gratefully acknowledge the courtesy \r\nof the Director and Officials of Kew to members of the \r\nExpedition who visited the Observatory for instruction. \r\nI know of no change in the Staff which can \r\nhave effected the loss of instructions or opportunities \r\nfor practising with meteorological instruments. \r\nI can therefore find no basis of fact for \r\nthe suggestions made in this paragraph and as I shall \r\nproceed to show , the misfortunes alleged to have resulted \r\nfrom the failure of 'well intentioned efforts' are as unsubstantiated as the cause to which they are traced. <u>For<\\u> \r\n",
