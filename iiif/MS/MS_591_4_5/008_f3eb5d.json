In taking a series of \r\nwind observations the observer naturally refers their \r\ndirections to the 'true' or 'magnetic' meridian according \r\nto which of these is most conveniently presented to his \r\nview. \r\nThus in a Ship winds are recorded 'magnetic' \r\nbecause they are most conveniently indicated by referring \r\nto the Compass; whereas on shore, vanes or bearings of \r\nobjects indicating the 'true' meridian, enable 'true' \r\ndirections of the wind to be more easily obtained. \r\nOn applying such common sense rules to the \r\nconditions of Mr Royds' journey there will be seen the \r\nstrongest probability that the winds were recorded 'true'. \r\nThe outward course of this party was S.E. 'true'. \r\nAll day long and every day constant attention was \r\nexercised in keeping a 'true' course. The tracks of \r\nthe sledges were 'true' and therefore the direction in \r\nwhich they were halted at night. A sense of 'true' \r\ndirection was vital to the party. \r\nOn the other hand it was crossing lines of \r\n<u>equal<\\u> \r\n",
