Royds' journey. \r\nIt would appear that a single glance at the \r\nsummaries of other journeys on this page and the excess \r\nof Southerly and South Westerly winds recorded would have \r\nshown the mistake of applying this 'correction'. \r\nBut what of the feelings of Lieutenant Royds \r\nand Mr Bernacchi?
