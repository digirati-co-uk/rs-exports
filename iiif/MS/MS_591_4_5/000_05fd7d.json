The evidence of fact is \r\npartially considered, certain facts are ignored and the \r\nsummarized results of observations are misrepresented. \r\nBefore treating this matter in detail I \r\nwould remark that the proofs of the volume were not seen \r\nby me or by any member of the Expedition before publication \r\nnor were the doubts formulated in them brought to our \r\nnotice. Further the suggestion made in the preface that \r\nOfficers of the Expedition were largely consulted with \r\nreference to specific points is not in accordance with \r\nfact. \r\nIn dealing with the first paragraph of Dr \r\nShaw's remarks headed 'Miscarriage of Instructions' \r\n(page VI) I put my comments in the for of questions \r\n<u>and<\\u> \r\n",
