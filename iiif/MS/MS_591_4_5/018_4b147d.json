At least two important considerations \r\nare ignored in this assertion, namely the possibility \r\nof denudation from the under surface and the effect of \r\nclimatic changes in the remote high level regions from \r\nwhich the ice springs. It is impossible to believe \r\nthat in making so bold a statement Mr Dines has duly \r\nconsidered all the facts which were at his disposal. \r\nOn pages 483 and 484 Mr R.H.Curtis comments \r\non the exposure of anemometers in a manner which shows \r\nthat he has been at no pains to inform himself of the \r\ndifficulties experienced. \r\nThis is especially evident in his remarks \r\non the 'self recording' anemometer and the 'sight \r\nindicating' anemometer. The difficulties we experienced \r\nwith the first instrument have already been pointed out \r\nand the substantial inaccuracy of Mr Curtis' comments \r\nmust be apparent. \r\nAs regards his remarks on the 'sight indicating' \r\nanemometer one has to ask how an observer cumbered with \r\nmits, a lantern and a recording board, walking through \r\nsnow and often compelled to cling to a guide rope, could \r\nhave also carried a portable anemometer to and from the \r\nobserving station. And again whether Mr Curtis has \r\never attempted to get a 'mean' reading of the instrument \r\nwhen the fluid was oscillating rapidly between such limits \r\nas 16 and 26. \r\n<u>With<\\u> \r\n",
