As far \r\nas my memory serves it was a perfectly \r\nproper remark which I took to refer to \r\nthe fact that this instrument was \r\ndelivered from Berlin at so late a date \r\nthat Mr. Bernacchi had to bring it out \r\nby mail steamer.\r\nI havent seen the Times review yet but \r\nI imagine that the reviewer has placed \r\nhis own interpretation on Dr. Chree\u2019s\r\nComment.\r\nThe following passage from the Review is \r\nquoted to me:-\r\n\u201cIn reviewing the meteorological observations \r\nof the Discovery a few months ago we had \r\noccasion to express regret that the observers \r\nset out on this important expedition with\r\nlittle or no preliminary training. To what \r\nwas said it is only necessary to add that \r\nthe observations in the present volume \r\nsuffered in the same way \u201c\r\nThere seems little doubt that an attack\r\non the expedition has been made to serve a private \r\nEnd but of course I cannot give a proper \r\nopinion until I have seen the Magnetic Volume \r\nWith apologies for again troubling you \r\nYours sincerely \r\nR.
