The Editor informs me that \u00a3400 has been realized and that he expects a margin with the \u00a3500 placed at my disposal. I shall now therefore command at least \u00a3900. We shall not need to buy any but fresh provisions during our stay here; the expenses of repair to the ship I cannot at present estimate, but I anticipate they will not be large and in addition there will only be the coal bill. I cannot say so with certainty, but at present I am of opinion that the above sums will see us clear of New Zealand.\r\nI will keep you informed as to advances made,at present I have advanced \u00a33. 10. 0 to every man on board, excepting Offices, but I shall of course have to draw further sums for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRobt. F. Scott",
