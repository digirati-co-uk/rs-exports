The appearance was\r\ntherefore probably due to a difference in\r\nrefractive powers of the fluid and lens.\r\n\r\nExamination of the fluid showed it to contain a\r\ntrace of dissolved protein, while weighings before\r\nand after puncture showed that it accounted\r\nfor one-third to one-half of the gains in\r\nweight at the end of two hours and for\r\nmore than half the gain in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe dogs lenses without capsules showed\r\nswelling causing the lens matter to bulge\r\nbetween the three limbs of the lens [text?]\r\nwhich remained as depressions.",
