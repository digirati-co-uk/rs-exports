But the dimensions of \r\nany of the figures may be changed, provided \r\nthe same proportions are observed & all the \r\nparts expressed. \r\nA mistake was made in drawing the coloured \r\nfigure No 4. which was not observed untill too \r\nlate to be corrected. the middle of the dividing \r\nring, expressed by part of a dotted circle, should have \r\npassed through the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. marked \r\nwith Ink. to supply this mistake, the circles of \r\nthe unshaded figure also marked as, may be \r\nsubstituted instead of those of the coloured one; \r\nthe letters & figures of reference will then agree \r\nwith the manuscript. \r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that \r\nthe rectilinear, circular or Elliptical  figures, \r\nwill be much easiest & best executed by a Machine \r\n& all the rest by Hand.\r\n",
