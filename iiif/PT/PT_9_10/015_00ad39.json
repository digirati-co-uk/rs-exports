The dimensions of these inter-\r\nsectionaries will also (caeteris paribus) diminish as the two \r\nsets of primaries approach each other, & enlarge as these \r\nare separated; & like Newtonian rings <s>rings<\\s> enlarge \r\nor diminish with the <s>greater or<\\s> less or greater elevation of the \r\nEye. it will be easy to conceive from inspection of fig 4 \r\nthat where an intersectionary set of rings is formed be-\r\ntween two sets of primaries of unequal magnitudes \r\nit must necessarily appear on the side towards the smal-\r\nler of the two primaries; which agrees with actual experiment. \r\nThe above hypothesis accounts for one set of intersection-\r\naries; but experiment shews that if one set appears it is \r\nalmost always accompanied by a second, sometimes equal but \r\noftener unequal in dimensions, as in fig. <s>5<\\s>3 at other times \r\npart of a third set appears as segments of circles only. \r\nit would, therefore, seem that they are formed not only between \r\nprimary setts, but also between primaries combined with \r\neither transmitted or reflected sets, provided the two between \r\nwhich they are formed, are unequal in dimensions.\r\n8 Ex. <s>16<\\s> The four sets of rings represented in fig. <s>5<\\s>3 \r\nwere produced by an arrangement consisting of two \r\nconvex lenses laid on each other, & a piece of plane \r\nlooking-glass plate laid on the uppermost lens. the ",
