Those formed without pressure, when the two conti-\r\nguous surfaces of plane glass slips are  parallel; are com-\r\nposed of feeble light & shade only without any perceptible \r\ncolour. these fringes which are much narrower than \r\nthe\r\n* What is meant by rectilinear phenomena, are those fringes \r\nwhether primary or Binary, that are formed between the \r\nsurfaces of the best plate glass, in contradistinction to those \r\nformed between lenses: altho strictly & mathematically speaking, \r\nnone have ever been seen perfectly streight, & without some \r\nirregularities; because it may be safely pronounced impracti\r\ncable, to polish any surface perfectly flat. \r\n+ Altho this word is not new, it it unavoidably employed \r\nin a new sense. <\\s>",
