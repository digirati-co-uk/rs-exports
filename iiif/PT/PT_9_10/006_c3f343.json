If a piece of unsilvered looking glass plate is laid hori-\r\nzontally on a table exposed to the light of a window, \r\n& if a piece of wire 3 or 4 inches long & 1/20 of an inch in \r\ndiameter is held over it, two distinct shadows will be \r\nperceived, one of which falls on the upper external surface, \r\n& the other on the lower internal surface of the glass plate. \r\nif the diameter of the wire is less than the thickness of \r\nglass plate, the two shadows will be clear of each other; \r\nbut if greater they will partly interfere, & as far as they \r\noverlap each other will form a darker shadow between them. \r\nEx 2. if two pieces of plate glass of the same dimensions are \r\nlaid on each other, & if two slips of wood about the thickness \r\nof a shilling are put between them one at each end, the \r\nsame wire held over them will give four shadows, \r\nviz - one for each surface: but if the two slips are taken \r\naway, the two middle shadows will coalesce into one, \r\nbecause the two adjoining surfaces form but one as to sense. \r\nfor the same reason, if three pieces of glass are laid on \r\neach<\\s>",
