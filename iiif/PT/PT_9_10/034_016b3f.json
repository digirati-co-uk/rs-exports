And as it has \r\nbeen showen in the 13th experiment, that coloured rays in \r\npassing each other are mutually affected therby; it is therfore \r\nhighly probable, that b this compound action & reaction, \r\nboth between the refracting strata & light, & between the rays \r\nof light themselves, the various phenomena are produced, \r\naltho' from the extream minuteness of all the operations of \r\nlight, a perfect knowledge of the mode of those operations, \r\nis more to be wished for than expected.<\\s> However \"as every Desideratum may be considered as an important discovery\" \r\nwhich when compleated may lead to others of still greater im-\r\nportance; & as the subject is so far from being exausted that \r\nperhaps we are only entering on a new career of \r\ndiscoveries, not only in opticks but in every other \r\nbranch of natural knowledge; in this point of view, \r\nthe prospect before us is rendered extensive as \r\nit is animating & delightful.\r\nJohn Know\r\nBelfast Octr 6 1812.\r\n",
