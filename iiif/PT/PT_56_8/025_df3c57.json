Before attempt-\r\ning to answer this question I must observe \r\nthat my description commences from a con=\r\ndition of this entozoon so complete, that \r\nno one, on examining it with the microscope \r\n& comparing it with those forms in which \r\nthe development is more advanced would \r\ndoubt their perfect similarity. But this \r\nform though so low is very far from being \r\nthe earliest indication of an abnormal state \r\nof the muscular fibres of all those animals \r\nwhich are infested ",
