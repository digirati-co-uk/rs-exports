Fig: 2 & 3.\r\nAs the first position of these animals \r\nis in the very substance of a primary mus=\r\ncular fasciculus, (See Plate 2 fig: 4) it \r\nis obvious that the mechanical action of \r\nthis apparatus will be to aid their longitudinal \r\ndevelopment whilst new cells are in pro=\r\ngress of formation in their interior. \r\nFor it is scarcely possible that the \r\nmuscular fibrillae by which they are \r\nsurrounded can when in action, fail \r\nby their friction to urge the two extremities \r\nonwards in opposite directions, whilst \r\nat the same time, the fibres, by which these entozoa are covered are in conse=\r\nquence of their direction preventing the \r\nseparated ends from regaining their \r\nformer position, & thus the two ends \r\nbeing always carried in opposite directions \r\nwithout the possibility of a counter \r\nmovement a general elongation must \r\nensue. This apparatus also, by splitting \r\nup the primary fasciculi, will serve a \r\nlocomotive purpose, & thus enable these \r\nanimals to reach the cellular intervals \r\nbetween the muscular fibres, where their \r\nfurther development will be completed. \r\nThat such is the effect of the fibres\r\nin question is evident on a careful \r\ninspection of some of the fasciculi in \r\nwhich these animalcules are contained, in \r\nwhich a separation of the fibrilla can \r\nbe ",
