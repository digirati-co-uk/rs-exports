The entire number of these \r\norgans is not in progress at the same time, but only about six are being \r\ndeveloped at once, which, when nearly \r\ncompleted, others make their appearance. \r\nThe primary condition of one of these organs \r\nis very remarkable, consisting merely of \r\na confused & irregular group of very bright \r\nparticles of a pale straw-colour of various shapes \r\nbut still all have a contour more or less \r\ncurvilinear, & the smaller ones are of a \r\nspherical figure. Their size varies from \r\nabout that of the third part of a handle of \r\na perfect hooklet, to a particle so minute \r\nas scarcely to be appreciable by the highest \r\npowers of the microscope. There are all the \r\nintermediate sizes between these extremes. \r\nNotwithstanding however, these extremes of size \r\n& form, all these particles possess the same \r\noptical & physical properties so as to be per-\r\nfectly recognisable both when apart & when \r\njoined together in the perfect hooklet. \r\nSee Plate 4. fig 4 & 5, in which they undergo \r\nno appreciable change in their general ap-\r\npearance. \r\nAt a period of the development a little \r\nmore advanced <s>a little more advanced<\\s> some \r\nparts of a hooklet can be recognised among \r\nthese various forms, especially the curved portion \r\nas \r\nfol. 9 Sig 2",
