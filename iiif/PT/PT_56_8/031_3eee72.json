In one class of these \r\nspecimens, I found scarcely any but \r\nadult cysticerci, after examining perhaps \r\nfifty different pieces, I might, however, find \r\none or two of the immature ones, but these \r\nwere always in the last stage of the ver=\r\nmicular form. In others, a second class, \r\nI could find only the earliest stages of the cys=\r\nticerci, & none of the perfectly formed ones. \r\nAnd in the third class of specimens, I found \r\nthem in every possible stage of development, \r\neven in the same field of the microscope. \r\nI think the last class of specimens was the \r\nlargest. \r\nNow the inference I deduce from these \r\nfacts is, firstly, that the animals from \r\nwhich the first set of specimens were taken \r\nhad some time prior to their being slaughtered \r\nbeen placed under circumstances favourable \r\nfor ",
