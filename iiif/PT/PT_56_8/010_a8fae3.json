They have \r\nnot the sharp, & well defined outline of \r\ntrue cilia, nor are they pointed like \r\nsetae, or curled like cirri. They have \r\nsomewhat the nature of white fibrous \r\ntissue, their distinctness being imposed \r\nby acetic acid. They are of different \r\nlengths in the same entozoon, & general=\r\nly longer, though not thicker in the large, \r\nthan in the small ones. Their length \r\naverages about 1/2100 of an inch. \r\nThe most remarkable circumstance con=\r\nnected with them is the great uniformity \r\nof their arrangement in different cysti=\r\ncerci. See Plate 2. fig: 2 & 3. They \r\ncover the whole of the outer surface of the \r\ninvesting membrane, & on opposite sides \r\nof the same entozoon, their form, size, \r\n& direction are similar, so that the \r\ntwo halves taken longitudinally are in \r\nthis respect symmetrical. If the \r\ndirection of these fibres be examined \r\nabout midway between the two extremi=\r\nties of one of these animalcules they \r\nwill be seen to project from the surface \r\nat right angles with the axis of its \r\nbody: but if traced each way from this \r\npoint they will be observed gradually to \r\nincline to this axis at an angle which \r\nkeeps diminishing as they approach the \r\ntwo extremities, so that the fibres nearest \r\nto the two ends almost coincide in their \r\ndirection with that of the axis, & thus \r\ncorrespond ",
