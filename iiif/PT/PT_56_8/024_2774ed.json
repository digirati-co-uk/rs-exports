These bodies appear as soon as \r\nthe hooklets & suckers, & they are as large \r\nwhen first formed as afterwards, but there \r\nare indications of the transverse wrinkles \r\nof the neck before either hooklets or suckers \r\ncan be distinguished. See Plate 4. figs: 2 & 3.\r\nThe neck afterwards continues to grow, so \r\nthat its relative length in respect to the \r\nventral portion is an indication of the age \r\nof a Cysticercus.\r\nIt is probable that this part does not \r\narrive at its full size until it is protruded, \r\nwhich I have never seen to be the case in \r\nany ",
