Each con=\r\nsists of a curved part resembling a bird\u2019s \r\nclaw, & a straight part or handle; and \r\nat the junction of these two parts there \r\nare rounded processes, or tubercles, two \r\nin the short hooklets, & only one in the \r\nlong ones, an anatomical mark by \r\nwhich the two kinds can be easily \r\ndistinguished. See Plate 1: fig. 6 (b) & (c). \r\nThey are composed of a very highly re \r\nfractive, dense & perfectly homogeneous \r\nsubstance possessed of a slight degree \r\nof elasticity & not acted upon by acetic \r\nacid. In the curved portion there is \r\na cavity filled with a fibrous material, \r\nthe other parts are perfectly solid. They are \r\nplaced (see Plate 1, fig: 5.) like the radii \r\nof a circle with the extremities of their \r\nhandles turned towards its centre, which \r\ncorresponds to the centre of the quadrangu\r\nlar area in which they are situated, & their \r\nhandles not meeting at this point circum\r\nscribe a small circular space which \r\nif perforated, would correspond to the mouth \r\nof the animalcule, but at this part \r\nthere is no opening. The membrane \r\nis simply depressed so as to present a \r\nconical hollow. By pressure upon the \r\nneck this part can be made to protrude \r\nin the form of a tongue-like process. \r\nThe handles of the hooklets are connected \r\nwith this process so that when it moves \r\nthey must move with it.
