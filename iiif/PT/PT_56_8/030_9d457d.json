Under the supposition \r\nthat the Cysticercus cellulosae are produced \r\nfrom the ova of tape worms these ought \r\nto be in those districts in which so many \r\nhundreds of measley pigs are fed, a corres=\r\nponding prevalence of intestinal tenia. \r\nIf such had been the case, it could hardly \r\nhave escaped notice.\r\nIf then the disease in question is \r\nnot produced from the ova of the cestoid ani=\r\nmalcules which to my mind seems \r\nscarcely possible, the question then arises, \r\nfrom what does it proceed -\r\nAt present I feel unable to answer \r\nthis <\\s>",
