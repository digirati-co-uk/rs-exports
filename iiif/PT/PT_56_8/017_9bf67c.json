This \r\nmeasures as it is thus folded up 1/16 of an inch \r\nin length.\r\nPlate 4, Fig: 1. shews a Cysticercus re=\r\nmoved from its adventitious cyst. It has \r\nstill somewhat of the folded character of the \r\npreceding specimen. This is 1/7 of an inch \r\nin length, & 1/28 in breadth. The interior \r\nof a cyst being smaller than the animal=\r\ncule contained therein, it naturally \r\nfollows, that during its growth, one \r\nportion must be folded over another. \r\nBy this means it is adapted to the \r\nconfined locality, in which it is lodged \r\nduring the period of its development. \r\nHence the ventral portions of all \r\nCysticerci are, when first taken from \r\ntheir cysts very much plicated, but \r\nthese plicae disappear, the ventral \r\nsac becoming distended soon after \r\na Cysticercus is placed in contact with \r\nfluid. \r\nUp to this point of the develop-\r\nment of the Cysticercus it is a simple \r\ncyst growing by the assimilation of \r\nfluid imbibed equally by every \r\npart of its surface, no one part dif=\r\nfering sensibly in its structure from \r\nanother. No portion of this surface pre=\r\nsents any indication of incipient \r\nhooklets or suckers. There is nothing \r\neither on its surface, or in its interior \r\nanalogous to the structure of an \r\novum ",
