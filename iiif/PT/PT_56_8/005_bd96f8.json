These bodies \r\nbegin to be formed as soon as the neck ap\r\npears & continue to increase in number \r\nas it increases in size.\r\nThe probable office of bodies so purely \r\nmechanical, both in their form & com\r\nposition is most likely one which is \r\npurely mechanical also. Perhaps by \r\ngiving a degree of solidity to the neck \r\nthey enable the circular, & longitudinal \r\nfibres entering into its composition, to \r\neffect its protrusion from the ventral ca\r\nvity, & thus serve as an example of a \r\nvery low type of an internal skeleton. \r\nThe terminal surface of the \r\nneck is of a quadrangular form, \r\neach angle being occupied by a circu\r\nlar disc or sucker, & its centre contains \r\nan apparatus of hooklets, (see Plate 1. \r\nfig: 2) & thus the four suckers & hook\r\nlets are all situated nearly upon the \r\nsame planes, a position which would \r\nbe advantageous for the employment \r\nof these organs when these animals \r\nare transferred from their deeply-seated \r\n& confined position between the muscular \r\nfibres to the free surface of the mucous \r\nmembranes. The suckers are of a circular \r\nfigure with a diameter of about 1/750 \r\nof an inch. See Plate 1. fig: 4.
