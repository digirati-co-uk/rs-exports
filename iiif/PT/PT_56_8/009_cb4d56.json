It soon however acquires \r\na very distinct membranous covering which \r\nis first apparent about its middle, & \r\nafterwards at its extremities. Its di=\r\nmensions in this stage of its formation \r\nmay be about 1/150 of an inch in length \r\n& 1/1500 in breadth, but these  are by no means regular. The external investment \r\nat first appears only as a bright line of \r\nhomogeneous substance best defined \r\non the side next the sarcous matter. It \r\nsoon however increases in thickness, & \r\nafterwards becomes converted into short \r\nfibres which increase in size & \r\ndistinctness as the animalcule grows \r\nlarger. These fibres are peculiar, \r\nthere ",
