They infest the heart in as great \r\nabundance as other muscles composed \r\nof striped fibres, where they are situated, \r\nsome in the substance of the walls of \r\nthe auricles & ventricles, others directly be\r\nneath the pericardium between it & the \r\n+ The observations described in this Paper were originally communicated to the \r\nRoyal Society on the   of   1855 See \u201cProceedings of the Royal Society\u201d for   1855",
