Nor is there any other anatomical \r\ncharacter which would raise its organisa=\r\ntion above that of a simple acephalacyst. \r\nHowever this so exactly resembles in its struct=\r\nure that of the ventral portion of a per=\r\nfect Cysticercus, that it is impossible \r\nto doubt their identity of character. \r\nIts size too is not much beneath that stage where the suckers & hooklets first \r\nbegin to present obscure indications of \r\nthe part they are about to occupy. \r\nI may observe moreover, that this form \r\n& all the preceding ones together with \r\nperfect cysticerci provided with the \r\nregular number of hooklets & suckers, \r\ncan in many specimens all be found \r\nintermixed together in a space not \r\nexceeding a square line. \r\nThe dimensions of that form of \r\nCysticercus in which there are obscure \r\nthough sufficiently certain indications \r\nof the site about to be occupied by \r\nthe neck of suckers, are about 1/10 of an \r\ninch in length, & 1/19 in breadth. \r\nSee Plate 4. fig: 2 & 3.\r\nThe first indication of the \r\naddition of the neck with the suckers \r\n& hooklets to the ventral part of a \r\nCysticercus is the appearance about \r\nits centre of a slightly raised body, \r\ndepressed in the middle with longi=\r\ntudinal folds proceeding from each \r\nside of it towards the poles of the ventral \r\ncyst, appearing as if at this part the \r\nparietes of the latter had been drawn \r\ninwards ",
