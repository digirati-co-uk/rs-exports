The external \r\nopening of this passage varies very much \r\nin different cysticerci, both in size \r\n& shape; but it is always smaller than \r\nthe internal one. It is difficult \r\nif not impossible to demonstrate by \r\nthe microscope alone, the existence \r\nof a passage through a sucker, however, \r\nthis fact admits of proof from the circum\r\nstance of the carbonic acid, which is \r\nevolved in the cavity of the neck from the decomposition of the calcareous \r\nbodies, when these animalcules \r\nare in acetic acid, being seen under \r\nthe microscope to pass freely through \r\nthe openings in the suckers. In the \r\nmembranous folds of the suckers both \r\ncircular, & radiating fibres are distinctly \r\nvisible, resembling in their general \r\ncharacters those in the neck already \r\nmentioned. See Plate 1. fig: 4. \r\nThe hooklets as before observed, are \r\nsituated in a circle around the centre \r\nof the square space before described, see \r\nPlate 1. fig: 2 & 5. They are generally \r\ntwenty-six in number, - thirteen long, \r\n& as many short, arranged alternately, \r\na long and a short one. Occasionally, but \r\nvery rarely, there are more, I have seen \r\nas many as twenty-nine. The longer \r\nhooklets \r\n",
