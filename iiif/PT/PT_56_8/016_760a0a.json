See Plate 2, fig: 2 & 3. \r\nThese projections gradually take on the \r\nform of those described on \r\nthe ventral part of the perfect entozoon. \r\nThe largest of the entozoa which I have \r\nseen in this stage is about 1/12 of an \r\ninch in length, & 1/40 in breadth.\r\nThe next facts requiring especial \r\nnotice are those connected with \r\nthat stage of development which takes \r\nplace after the animalcule has \r\nbecome surrounded by an adven=\r\ntitious cyst.\r\nThe first indication of the forma-\r\ntion of a cyst is, the turgescency \r\nof the capillaries, or some of the small=\r\ner vessels in the vicinity of one or \r\nmore entozoa. Granular bodies, \r\nexudation corpuscles, & fibres of different \r\nshapes next make their appearance. \r\nThese at first obscure the entozoon & \r\nafterwards completely conceal it. When \r\nthe cyst is first formed the animalcule \r\ncan by a good light & careful examina=\r\ntion be obscurely seen within it, & by \r\ndissection under the microscope it can \r\nbe dislodged.
