In this condition of the entozoon \r\nthere is nothing in this space which has \r\nthe slightest resemblance to the parts \r\nwhich are there about to be developed, \r\nnamely, the hooklets, suckers, & earthy \r\nconcretions; & it is only by the comparison \r\nof these obscure appearances with other specimens in which the \r\ndevelopment of the hooklets is a little \r\nmore advanced, that their true significa=\r\ntion is to be learned - See Plate 4, \r\nfig: 4 & 5.\r\nOf these parts I will first describe \r\nthe development of the hooklets, there \r\nbeing the most remarkable & charac=\r\nteristic organs of a Cysticercus. \r\nBy comparing the preceding specimens \r\nwith one in which some of the hooklets \r\nare in progress of development, & suf=\r\nficiently advanced in their formation \r\nto ",
