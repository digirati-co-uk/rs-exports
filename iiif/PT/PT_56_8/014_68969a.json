Next these \r\ncorpuscles lose their spherical form & become \r\nflattened, & lastly they assume their cha=\r\nracteristic elliptical or reniform figure \r\nbefore mentioned (See Plate 1. Fig: 10) \r\nwhich they retain as long as the ento=\r\nzoon remains in its primary muscular \r\nfasciculus. This shape however is not \r\nessential to these corpuscles but merely \r\nresults from the rounded form of the \r\nmasses into which they are grouped \r\ntogether, each corpuscle by its convexity \r\nforming a segment of the circular \r\noutline of its respective mass. These \r\ncorpuscles contain very fine dark granules \r\nso variously disposed in different ones, as \r\nto present a variety of appearances, such \r\nas circular or oval spaces which might \r\nbe taken for nuclei or nucleoli.
