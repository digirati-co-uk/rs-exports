The following outline of what\r\nhas been previously ascertained respecting it (for which I am indebted to M. D'Orbigny <sup>1</sup>), will show that\r\nno minute examination of it has been attempted previously to\r\nmy own researches, and that the nature of its organization \r\nhas not been at all understood._ Most of the species at present\r\nknown are fossils, occurring in association with Nummu-\r\n<u>lites</u>, <u>Orbitolites</u>, &c in the Nummulitic limestone, or in\r\nother formations which represent it; and the <s>form</s> examples\r\nfirst described (by Fortis) were confounded with Nummulites and\r\nOrbitolites under the term <u>Discolites</u>.
