Three species are described and figured by\r\nFichtel<u>l</u> and Moll <sup>1</sup>, under the names of <u>Nautilus orbiculus</u>,\r\n<u>N.angulatus</u>, and <u>N.aduncus</u>. Lamarck, however, in his\r\nfirst systematic treatise, <sup>2</sup> separated them from <u>Nautilus</u>, and\r\nraised them to the rank of an independent genus, to which\r\nhe gave the name of <u>Orbiculina</u>; and he also changed the\r\n<s>names of</s> two of the specific names, the three standing respec-\r\ntively as <u>O. numismalis</u>, <u>O.angulata</u>, and <u>O.uncinata</u>. By\r\nDenys de Montfort, <sup>3</sup> these species were raised to the rank of\r\nindependent genera, under the names of [<u>Helenis</u>?], <u>Archaias</u>,\r\nand <u>Ilotes</u>; but these genera have not been adopted by any other\r\nsystematist. M. d'Orbigny, <sup>4</sup>   in his first classification of the\r\nForaminifera, not merely adopted Lamarck's generic designa\r\ntion, but affirmed that the three reputed species were really\r\nnothing else that one and the same organism in different\r\n\r\n1.
