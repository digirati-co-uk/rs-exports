This variety is chiefly interesting,\r\nas showing how little importance is to be attached to smaller\r\ndeviations of the same kind. The most remarkable example\r\nof it which I have met with, is represented in Plate VII Fig 2\r\nwhich is the marginal portion of the disk whose central\r\nportion is shown in Fig. 4. In Plate V Figs 3.4 are represented\r\ntwo examples of irregularity in the disposition of the superficial\r\nand intermediate cells in the zones immediately surrounding\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\n61 Lastly I have to mention, that the septa dividing the\r\ncontiguous cells of the same zone are occasionally deficient,\r\nso that the interior of the zone is a continuous circular passage\r\n with only slight indications of the normal divisions,",
