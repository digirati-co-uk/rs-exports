For it is obvious that\r\nthe smaller disk which is surrounded by the outer zones\r\nof the larger one, has been developed from a nucleus of its own;\r\nand this nucleus does not appear to have any direct\r\nconnection with the periphery, still less with the centre\r\nof the larger disk; and on the other hand, when we consider\r\nthe circumstances under which Orbitolites grow (\u00a734), it is\r\nvery easy to understand that the smaller and younger\r\nindividual, having attached itself in too near proximity to the\r\nlarger and older one, should become imbedded therein\r\n(so to speak) by the extension of the newly forming zones\r\npf the latter around its margin. In fact, the manner in\r\nwhich the outer zones of the larger disk envelope the smaller,\r\nprecisely corresponds with that in which we have seen the\r\nthe new zones originating from the uninjured margin of a mutilated\r\nspecimen to extend<s>ing</s> themselves along its fractured edges (\u00a737).",
