For\r\nfrom the surface of the disk, there rises a triradiate crest,\r\nformed by three vertical plates meeting one another at nearly\r\nequal angles, but all of them nearly perpendicular to the\r\nplane on which they rest. It is a very remarkable feature\r\nin this specimen, however, that the line in which the three\r\nvertical planes meet, is traceable at its base to the nucleus\r\nof the horizontal disk; so that they all bear the same\r\nrelation to it as does the single outgrowth in the instances\r\npreviously cited. Hence we may attribute all these\r\nmonstrosities to an excess of productive power in the sarcode\r\nof the original nucleus, which has put forth its first\r\nextension, not merely in the horizontal, but also in\r\nthe perpendicular direction; the whole subsequent\r\ndevelopment of these outgrowths taking place after the\r\nnormal plan from the foundations thus laid. _ It is interesting\r\nto remark, that the presence of such outgrowths as those now\r\ndescribed is far more frequent in certain localities than it is\r\nin others.
