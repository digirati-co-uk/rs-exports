The shape of the cells is sometimes marked\r\nout in unusual strength by the convexity of its lid or cover as shown\r\nin Plate X Fig. 4; and this feature is so pronounced in the large\r\nfossil Orbitolites of the Paris basin,  as to become visible to the\r\nnaked eye. A very marked diversity in its degree, however, as well\r\nas in the size of the cells, may be noticed in the contiguous zones\r\nof the same specimen in (Plate V, Fig. 9); whence it is obvious that\r\nthe convexity is a mere accidental variation, and is a character\r\nof no value whatever as regards the differentiation of species.\r\n_ The relation of the rounded to the square or oblong cells is\r\nmade evident by the occurrence of intermediate links of\r\ntransition.
