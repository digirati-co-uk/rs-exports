If the originals of Plate X, Figs 3.4.6.9 and 12 had happened\r\nto have presented themselves to the Systematist without any of the connecting\r\nforms, he might have been pardoned for describing them as distinct species\r\ncharacterised by well marked differences in the form and arrangement of\r\ntheir cells; but no such differentiation can be admitted in the face of the\r\nfact, that these are only extreme examples of variations which show\r\nthemselves in a minor degree between almost every two specimens\r\nbrought into comparison, and even between the different parts of the\r\nsame disk.
