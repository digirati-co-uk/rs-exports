Surface of a disk, whose outer layer, composed of nearly\r\nsquare closed cells, has been partly ground-away, so as\r\nto lay open the columnar cells of the intermediate layer:-\r\n24 diam.\r\n2. Horizontal section of the intermediate layer, passing (in\r\nconsequence of the flexure of the disk, through two diffe-\r\nrent planes, and thus showing the two different direc-\r\ntions of the oblique passages which connect columnar cells of\r\ndifferent zones; also showing a marked difference in\r\nthe size of adjacent cells:- 100 diam.\r\n3. Horizontal section of the intermediate layer, immedi-\r\nately beneath the floors of the superficial cells, <s>showing</s> laying open\r\nthe annular canals, with the summits of the colum-\r\nnar cells:- 100 diam.\r\n4. Nucleus and surrounding zones of a disk of simple type, somewhat eccentri-\r\ncally developed; the beak-like projections at each side of\r\nthe pores opening into the new zones (shown in Fig. 11)",
