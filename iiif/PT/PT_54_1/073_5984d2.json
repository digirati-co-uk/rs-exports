It may be presumed\r\nto be the calcification of the surface of this beaded ring of\r\nsarcode, that the formation of the shelly zone is accomplished; and\r\nif the calcifying process commence on the segments, and extend\r\nfrom these along the surface of their connecting stolons, we can\r\nunderstand why the passages that are left for communication\r\nwith the exterior, should arise from the intermediate divisions\r\nof the annular canal, instead of from the segments themselves.",
