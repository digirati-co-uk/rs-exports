It is observable, however, that\r\njust at the point at which the contiguous passages meet each\r\nother, there is always a round aperture (f,f',f\") in the partition\r\n(<u>g,g</u>) which divides the contiguous cells of each zone; and when, in\r\na horizontal section, the superficial cells have been entirely ground-away, so as to lay\r\nopen the most superficial part of the intermediate stratum, this\r\npart is found to be traversed <s>is found</s> in each zone by a continuous circular\r\ncanal (Plate IV, Fig 3), with large rounded openings that lead\r\ninto the columnar cells beneath.",
