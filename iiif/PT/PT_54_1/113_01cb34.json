In the specimen of which two different aspects are\r\nshown in Fig. 2, and two other aspects under higher magnifying\r\npowers in Figs 4. 5, it would seem difficult to say which is\r\nthe primary and which the secondary disk, and it would be\r\nmore correct to describe the entire structure as consisting of a\r\nsingle half-disk A.B and of two half disks B.C and C.D, meeting A___B__C\r\n                                __D\r\neach other at an acute angle C.B.D. neither of them being in the same\r\nplane with the single half-disk, but both of them meeting it at\r\nsimilarly obtuse angles A.B.C and A.B.D. The opening of one of\r\nthe obtuse angles is shown in Fig 4, and that of the acute in\r\nFig 5; and in each view it is seen, that the divergence takes\r\nplace in a plane which passes through the common centre of all\r\nthree.
