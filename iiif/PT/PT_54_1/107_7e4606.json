In the\r\nspecimen figured in Plate VII Fig 8 we see this to be the case only\r\nwith the <u>three</u> zones nearest the centre; in that represented in\r\nPlate V Fig 2 the canal is single in the <u>five</u> inner zones; whilst\r\nin that represented in Plate VII Fig.4, the canal is single for the\r\nfirst twenty-three zones. Whenever the annulus canal is single,\r\nthe upper and lower superficial cells also become continuous\r\nand form a series of columnar cells in every respect similar to\r\nthose of the simple type. (compare Plate II Fig. 4 with the\r\nportion <u>a-b</u> of Plate VII Fig 4) If, then, the growth of either\r\nof these disks had been checked within the first zone<s>,</s> in which\r\nits annular canal becomes double, it would have been accounted\r\nas belonging to the simpler type; and the wide variation which\r\nhere shows itself, in regard to the distance from the nucleus<s>,</s> at\r\nwhich the more complex type begins to be assumed, sufficiently\r\nexplains the fact already noticed (\u00a722), that although the disks\r\nof this 'simple' type are for the most part of minute size, yet that the\r\ndiameter of many of them exceeds that of the smaller disks of\r\nthe complex type.",
