For the\r\nouter margin of the circumambient segment of the nucleus is seen to\r\ngive off a number of slender prolongations or 'stolons' of sarcode, which\r\nradiate from it to a short distance, and then enlarge into columnar\r\nsegments of circular or ovoidal <s>form</s> base, which are united with each other\r\nlaterally by an annular 'Stolon'; and from the <s>-</s> portions of this\r\n'stolon' which intervene between the segments of each annulus of\r\nsarcode, are given off the radiating 'stolons' that go to originate the next\r\nzone, the arrangement of whose parts is precisely similar to that just described\r\n\r\n18. In this manner, any number of concentric zones may be formed, which\r\nare exact repetitions of each other, except that the number of segments",
