The cells of the next row, 6.6, are more\r\nnumerous, but are themselves exceeded by those of the zone 7.7, which\r\nnot only surrounds it, but extends further backwards upon the\r\nnucleus.  So the cells of the Zones 8.8, 9.9, 10.10, 11.11, and  12.12, progressively\r\nincrease in numbers, and each zone extends itself further back upon\r\nthe nucleus; until those of the last of these zones nearly meet upon\r\nits yet unenclosed margin.
