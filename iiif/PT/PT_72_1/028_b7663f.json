In order to separate \r\nthese colours more distinctly from each \r\nother, the aureola, moved by the slightest \r\nbreath may be extended into a large \r\nsurface by blowing it sideways. But \r\nthe separation may be best made when the discharge \r\ntakes place between the two poles of an \r\nElectromagnet, in the equatorial direction.\r\nWhile the straight <s>lightening<\\s> spark is not acted \r\nupon by the Electromagnet to any sensible \r\ndegree, the aureola is expanded into a fine \r\nsurface, bounded by the <s>lightning<\\s> spark starting \r\nfrom one to the other extremity of the electrodes \r\nand by a semicircle passing through these extre \r\nmities. At a certain rarefaction of air this sur \r\nface appeared most beautifully bounded by a semi\r\ncircular golden coloured band and <a>bisected<\\s> divided by \r\na similar band into two parts +. We may \r\nexplain now in a satisfactory way, the appearence \r\nhitherto mysterious of the golden light. Both \r\nthe yellow <a>as well as<\\s> and the blue light are owing \r\nto the Nitrogen of the air, reduced by the heat \r\nof the current into the two allotropic states which \r\nexhibit the spectra of channeled space and of \r\nbands. The brilliant white light of the <s>lightening<\\s> spark[?]\r\npartly belongs to the oxygen partly to the \r\nnitrogen of the air, both highly ignited, the \r\nnitrogen being in that allotropic state, in which \r\nit exhibits the spectrum of bright lines.\r\n31.
