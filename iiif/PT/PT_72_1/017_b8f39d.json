All have the same general cha \r\nracter, but not the same brightness. From \r\nthe extreme red the intensity of light increases \r\nto the 8th band, over the 9th, 10th, and 11th,\r\nespecially over the last two ones a shadow \r\nis spread, which gives to the red a rather \r\nbrownish tint. The next seven bands are \r\nof a fine orange and yellow colour.\r\nThe 19th and 20th band[s] are very dark,\r\nthe 21th is less dark. The following bands \r\nhave a green colour, varying in brightness.\r\nThe darkest are the 28th and 29th, succeeding \r\nto the lightest ones.\r\nThe cause producing these bands and their \r\nshading by dark transverse lines is evi \r\ndently not the same as that which pro \r\nduces the shadow overspreading some \r\nof them. <u>It <\\u> [This] may be for instance con\r\ncluded from the fact, that the shadow \r\nwhich darkens the 19th, and the 20th band, without \r\nentirely destroying their limits, spreads \r\nat the same time over the neighbouring \r\nthird part of the preceeding 18th band.",
