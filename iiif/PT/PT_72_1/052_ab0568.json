When the direct \r\ndischarges of Ruhmkorff\u2019s large induction \r\ncoil is sent through the old spectrum \r\ntubes, enclosing hydrogen, the formerly \r\nobtained spectrum is essentially altered.\r\nBy increasing the power of the coil the \r\nviolet line H[gamma] first expands, while it conti \r\nnues to expand the expansion of the bluish \r\ngreen line H[beta] becomes visible. Let the apper \r\nture of the slit be regulated so, that the \r\ndouble sodium-line will separate into two \r\nsingle lines, nearly touching one another. Thus\r\nthe angular breadth of H[beta] becoming 2 or \r\n3 minutes, the breadth of H[gamma] is about \r\nthe double. The expa[n]sion takes place as well \r\ntowards the less as toward the more refracte[d]\r\npart of the spectrum.
