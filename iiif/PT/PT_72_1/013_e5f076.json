According to the \r\nwidth of the slit and the dispersive power\r\nof the prisms the two well defined images \r\n<s>of<\\s> having both the breadth of the slit, if \r\nobserved without the interposed prisms,\r\nare either superposed, or, touch one ano \r\nther, or, are separated by a black space. In \r\nmaking use of the two prisms we generally regu \r\nlated the aperture of the slit so that the \r\ntwo small sodium-bands appeared se \r\nparated by a black space <s>of<\\s> having near \r\nly the breadth of these bands. In this \r\ncase the angle at which the aperture of \r\nthe slit is seen is equal to half the an\r\ngular distance of the two middle lines \r\nof the bands and therefore equal to half \r\nthe angular distance of the two sodium \r\nbands <s>it<\\s>themselves after being reduced by \r\nnarrowing the slit, to mathematical lines.\r\nIf the images touch <s>one<\\s> each <s>an<\\s>other <s>both<\\s>,\r\nthe aperture of the slit and the two \r\nsodium-lines are seen at the same angle ",
