After one of \r\nus published his first researches on the spectra of ignited gases Mr \r\nvan der Willigen, in operating with strong induced currents, determi \r\nned in a similar way the maxima of intensity of the hydrogen spectrum.\r\nThe spectra thus obtained are not <s>indic<\\s>[calcul]ated to prove the connexion \r\nexisting between the bright lines of ignited gases or vapours and Fraun \r\nhofer\u2019s dark lines of the solar spectrum.
