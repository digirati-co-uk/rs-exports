Accordingly, if Oxygen, en \r\nclosed in the spectral tube be replaced \r\nby common air, the spectrum of the \r\nOxygen it contains does not appear \r\nuntil after interposing the Leyden jar.\r\nWe do not enter here into the detail of the \r\nOxygen-spectrum, but conclude with a \r\ngeneral remark. Nearly all luminou[s]\r\nlines of the spectra of the second order \r\nexpand when the temperature of the igni \r\nted gas increases beyond a certain limit;\r\nbut neither [do] all lines reach the same bright \r\nness before expanding, nor do the lines \r\nin the different parts of the spectrum ex \r\npand at the same temperature. That is seen \r\nbest in the spectrum of the second order \r\nof Oxygen. The bright lines constituting the \r\ncharacteristic groups of its middle part \r\noppose the greatest resistance to expansion. \r\nIf they are best defined, the luminous lines \r\ntowards the red extremity, most distinct \r\nat a lower temperature, are already ex \r\npanded, while towards the violet extremi \r\nty, the luminous lines are scarcely deve \r\nloped; they will be brightly developed, become \r\nwell defined and extend very far, after the \r\nignited Oxygen reaches a temperature,\r\nat which the groups of the middle part \r\nare expanded. Hence arises the difficulty ",
