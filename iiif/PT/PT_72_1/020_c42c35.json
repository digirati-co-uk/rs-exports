Now instead of the direct discharge \r\nof Ruhmkorff\u2019s large induction coil, let us \r\nsend through the very same spectral tubes \r\nthe discharge of the interposed Leyden jar.\r\nThe spectrum then obtained has not \r\nthe least resemblance to the former one.\r\nThe variously shaded bands which we hitherto \r\ndescribed are replaced by brilliant lines \r\non a more or less dark ground. Neither \r\nthe distribution of these new lines nor their \r\nrelative brightness gives any indication \r\nwhatever of a law. Never the less the place \r\noccupied by each of them remains under \r\nall circumstances invariably the same.\r\nIf exactly determined each line not only undoubtedly \r\nannounces the gas within the tube, but \r\nthe gas may be \r\nrecognised at the first sight by characteristic \r\ngroups into which the lines are collected.\r\n21. The new spectrum of Nitrogen extends \r\ntowards the red slightly beyond the Hydrogen-line \r\nH[alpha], which if the gas be not dried with care \r\nwill be seen simultaneously, enclosed by \r\ntwo red nitrogen lines, the less refracted of which ",
