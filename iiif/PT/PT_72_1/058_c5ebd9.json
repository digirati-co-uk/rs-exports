Among them there \r\nis one, announcing at first sight the pre\r\nsence of vapour of Phosphorus: a triple \r\norange line, formed by two single lines of \r\nfirst intensity and a third less bright one, \r\nbisecting the interval between them. The \r\nother brightest lines are seen within the green.\r\nWe got no difference at all by intro \r\nducing into the spectral tube either \r\ncommon or red Phosphorus. After the \r\ncurrent passed for some time, common \r\nPhosphorus was seen, within the tube, \r\ntransformed into a subtle powder of \r\n[the] red <s>one<\\s> [kind].\r\n65. <u>Chlorine, Bromine <\\u> and <\\Jodine<\\u> were among \r\nthe substances first submitted to spectral \r\nAnalysis by one of us. In resuming the \r\nsubject we fully confirmed the formerly \r\nobtained results, that not any two of \r\nthe numerous spectral lines, characterising \r\nthe three substances, were coincident.\r\nBy means of the electric current we \r\ngot in all instances only spectra of the \r\nsecond order. We were especially desirous \r\nof ascertaining, whether there existed a \r\nspectrum of Iodine, corresponding to \r\na lower temperature, the inverse or negative ",
