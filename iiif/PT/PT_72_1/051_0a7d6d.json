The spectrum \r\none of us obtained by sending the discharge \r\nof Ruhmkorff\u2019s small induction coil through \r\none of the highly evacuated spectral tubes,\r\nconstructed by Mr. Geissler, shows only three \r\nbright lines, which he denoted by H[alpha], H[beta] and \r\nH[gamma]. The beautiful red light of the ignited \r\nrarefied gas, divided into these three bright \r\nlines, even after having passed through the \r\nfour prisms of Steinheil\u2019s spectral apparatus, remains highly concentrated. At a magni \r\nfying power of 72, the three bright lines \r\nor small bands, thus obtained, are well \r\ndefined. Their apparent breadth is equal to \r\nthe breadth of the slit, they approach gra \r\ndually to mathematical lines. Hence we \r\nconclude that, under the above mentioned \r\nconditions the length of wave of the light , consti \r\ntuting each of the three Hydrogen lines is \r\nconstant and remains so, if expanded into \r\nbands. In referring the middle lines of such \r\nbands to the middle line of the direct image \r\nof the slit, we obtain its angle of refraction.\r\nIt was proposed to employ these middle \r\nlines instead of Fraunhofer\u2019s dark lines \r\nof the solar spectrum in determining the \r\nindices of refraction. + This proceding has \r\nsince been proved to be very expedient. +\r\nLandolt.
