In sending the direct discharge of \r\nRuhmkorff\u2019s coil through a tube of glass \r\nfrom 1/4 to 1/8 of an inch in diameter,\r\nprovided with electrodes of platinum or \r\nof aluminium enclosing Hydrogen at a \r\ntension of 5 to 10mm a luminous threath \r\nof light of a bluisch-white colour was \r\nseen passing along the axis of the tube,\r\nwithout touching the glass. When analysed \r\nby the prism, it gave a faint spectrum of \r\nthe above mentioned numerous <s>lum<\\s> bright \r\nlines, especially within the red and the \r\nyellow. Among these lines neither H[alpha] nor \r\nH[gamma] were seen, H[beta] only appeared, but less \r\nbright than many of the other lines. By \r\ninterposing the Leyden jar and gradually \r\nincreasing its charge (12), all lines became \r\nbrighter, H[beta] surpassing all other lines in \r\nbrilliancy; H[alpha] appeared beautifully, H[gamma] fainter.\r\nHence we conclude that the numerous bright \r\nlines belong neither to the vaporised metal \r\nof the electrodes, nor to the decomposed in \r\nterior surface of the glass, but solely to the \r\nhydrogen, constituiting a new spectrum \r\nof it. This spectrum may be seen simul \r\ntaneously with the three characteristic \r\nlines H[alpha], H[beta], H[gamma]; but, at an increased tem \r\nperature, when these lines begin to expand,\r\nit entirely disappears.\r\n62. We got only one spectrum of <u>Oxygen<\\u>\r\nin operating exactly in the same way as \r\nwe did in the case of nitrogen, with that ",
