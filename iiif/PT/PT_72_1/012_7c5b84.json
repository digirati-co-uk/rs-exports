Thus \r\nthe Leyden jar is the most proper and most \r\neasy means for shortening the duration of the \r\ndischarge and consequently <s>to<\\s> increas<s>e<\\s>[ing] the \r\ntemperature of the gas \r\n12. In several cases, especially if a vapour \r\nlike that of mercury be examined, which \r\nisolates less, it will be found more conv \r\nnient, instead of replacing the Leyden jar by a \r\nlarger one, to increase the charge of the \r\nsame jar by intercalating into the circuit \r\na spark micrometer, by means of which \r\nyou may add, to the resistance within the \r\nspectral tube, the resistance of any stratum of air.\r\n13. The leading idea by which one of us was \r\nguided when he first (1857) directed his at \r\ntention to spectral Analysis, was to concen \r\ntrate the light in Geissler\u2019s tubes, <s>by<\\s> in confining \r\nthe electric current within a capillary channel:\r\n<s>Hence<\\s> The construction of our tubes immediately \r\n<u>derives <\\u> follows from it.

The length of this \r\npart is of very little influence if the tubes \r\nare very highly exhausted; we had to shorten \r\n<s>it<\\s> our recent tubes, intended to enclose gases \r\nand vapours of a greater density, rendered \r\nLuminous by a powerful induction coil.\r\n13.
