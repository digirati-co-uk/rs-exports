Instead of these groups there is \r\nquite a new configuration. Equally distant \r\nfrom the place,\r\n[which] the groups occupied in the \r\nformer spectrum, a small well defined black \r\nband was seen, bounded on the more re\r\nfracted side by a violet space which, being of \r\ngreat brilliancy where it touches the band, was \r\nshaded gradually till the spectrum, not extending \r\nbeyond the place of the group (g), was extinguished.\r\nThis violet space is traversed by well defined \r\ndark lines equally distant from each other \r\nbut more apart than the shading lines we \r\ndescribed in former cases. The black band is \r\nbounded on its less refracted side by a bright \r\nline, having the breadth of the lines of the \r\ncharacteristic groups, which, at a certain \r\ndistance, was preceded by a more diffused \r\nviolet light, traversed, like the brilliant [one] on \r\nthe opposite side, by dark but less <s>brilliant<\\s> distinct \r\nlines. Here also the faint group (f) appeared.\r\nThe distribution of light and shade pro \r\nducing the configuration just described,\r\nis seen also, distinctly but faintly, in the \r\nspectrum we obtained by the combustion of \r\ncyanogen with oxygen, where at the same \r\ntime the groups (e) and (g) are beautifully \r\nexpressed.
