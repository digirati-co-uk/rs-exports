There \r\nis no doubt that the different types correspond \r\nto different degrees of temperature: the \r\ntemperature being lowest when the bands \r\nare principally developed; lower in the \r\ncase of the second set of groups than in \r\nthe case of the first; lower in the case of \r\nthe shadowed large fields than in the case \r\nwhere the characteristic groups appear \r\nsimultaneously.\r\n56.
