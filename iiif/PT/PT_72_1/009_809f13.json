In this case the electric \r\nlight is more bright and of a fine colour \r\nlike that of blue steel. When analysed by\r\nthe prism, it shows the spectral lines \r\nof hydrogen and oxygen, mixed with other \r\nspectral lines, among which those of \r\nsodium and silicium are the brightest.\r\nAt the same time the interior surface of \r\nthe capillary part of the tube tarnishes.\r\nHence we conclude that the decomposed \r\nglass partly conducts the current.\r\nBy means of our tubes therefore the \r\ntheoretical conclusions of Dr. <u>Faraday<\\u>:\r\nthat Electricity being merely a peculiar \r\ncondition of ponderable matter, can not \r\nexist without it and can not move \r\nwithout being carried by it, are con \r\nfirmed and supported in a striking way.*\r\n9. As soon as the tube encloses perceptible \r\ntraces of air, the spectral lines resulting \r\nfrom the ingredients of the glass entirely \r\ndisappear. Though the temperature of \r\nTacit[?] note \r\n* Mr Gussiot has already \r\nobtained vacua so nearly \r\nperfect as to present an obstacle to\r\nelectric conduction.
