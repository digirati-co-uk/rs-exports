One of us in his \r\npublication of 1859, not being guided <s>[text?]<\\s> by any theoretical view on \r\nthis point, first announced the coincidence of H[beta] with Fraunhofers <s>G<\\s> F,\r\nand fixed the position of H[gamma] near G, of H[alpha] at a distance of 2 minutes \r\nfrom C. When, at a later period he made use of <u>Steinheits<\\u> large spec \r\ntral apparatus he pointed out at first sight the exact coincidence of \r\nH[alpha] with C, H[gamma] with a marked black line at some distance from G\r\ntowards F. In operating with spectral tubes Mr Angstrom con \r\nfirmed these results. (The spectroscop[e] employed in 1859 being a small \r\nan imperfect one, there was given to the slit an aperture of more than \r\n3 minutes. The adjustment was made with regard to H[beta]. Hence the error \r\nfinally made in determining the position of H[alpha] may be fully explained \r\n[by <s>supposing<\\s> the circumstance] that the illuminated board of the slit was observed instead of the \r\nilluminated aperture itself.) + Angstrom: Uber den Fraunhofer\u2019schen  Linien \r\nim Sonnenspectrum Pogg.

Even in the old spectral tubes enclosing \r\nhighly rarefied hydrogen, the ground, \r\nfrom which the three characteristic lines \r\nrise, did not appear always of the same \r\ndarkness, in some instances new bright \r\nlines appeared, especially in the neighbor \r\nhood of the Sodium-line.
