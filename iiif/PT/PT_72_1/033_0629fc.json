After a last band, traversed by H[gamma], a larger strongly \r\nshadowed space extended towards the ex \r\ntreme violet. The breadth of the bands \r\nincreased from the less to the more re \r\nfracted part of the spectrum. In each \r\nband, contrary to what takes place in the \r\ncase of nitrogen, namely with regard \r\nto its channeled spectrum, the shading \r\nproduced by five[?] dark lines decreases \r\nfrom the less to the more refracted extre \r\nmity. The darkest part of the shadow is \r\nbounded by a small separate band of \r\na various appearance, generally formed \r\nby two small bright lines including a \r\nsomewhat larger dark one. By these small \r\nbands the purely channeled character of \r\nthe spectrum is disturbed.\r\n37. If, while the discharge is passing we \r\ncontinue to heat the tube by a lamp \r\nthe brightness of the spectrum always \r\nincreases, but, if we approach to a certain \r\ndegree of temperature in different parts \r\nof the spectrum we described bright colou \r\nred lines belonging to the Sulphur spec \r\ntrum of the second order appeared and \r\ndisappeared again according to the fluc \r\ntuating heat, till at last the second of \r\nthe two rival spectra remained undisturbed.\r\nThe colour of the light was changed.
