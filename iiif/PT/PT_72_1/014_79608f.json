The first fact which we discovered in operating \r\nwith our tubes, guided by the above explained \r\nprinciples, was the following one.\r\n<u>There is a certain number of elementary \r\nsubstances, which, when differently heated,\r\nfurnish two kinds of spectra of quite a different \r\ncharacter not having any line or any band \r\nin common<\\u>.\r\nThe fact is important as well with regard \r\nto theoretical conceptions as to practical \r\napplications, the more so as the passage \r\nfrom one kind of spectra to the other is by \r\nno means a continuous one, but takes \r\nplace abruptley. By regulating the tem \r\nperature you may repeat the two spectra \r\nin any succession <u>ad libitum<\\u>.\r\nWe will now treat more explicitely the case \r\nof <u>Nitrogen<\\u> which first unfolded to us its \r\ndifferent spectra. These spectra obtained in the easiest and most striking way have been \r\nexamined by us in every point of view.\r\nThe other cases of double spectra may \r\nhereafter be spoken of in a more sum[m]ary manner.\r\n15. <s>In order to get obtain pure Nitrogen <\\s> We examined Nitrogen prepared in \r\ndifferent ways, even in the state \r\nof greatest purity. But we found \r\nthat, in order to get pure spectra of it, it was not necessary to free\r\nthe gas from all traces of air * Whatever that may be, under certain \r\nconditions, the practical importance \r\nof prismatic Analysis in detecting cer \r\ntain substances, converted into vapour,\r\nwhatever may be its use in indicating tra \r\nces of a single gas imperceptible by other \r\nmeans: mixtures of permanent gases are \r\nnot fitted to be examined by the prism.
