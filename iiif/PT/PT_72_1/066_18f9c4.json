You may put this in type but \r\nnot in page till you get the paper, which I will send from \r\nCambridge tonight 9/6/65\r\n1865\r\nExplanation of the Plates.\r\nIn determining the different spectra both of the \r\nfirst and the second order, the dispersing prisms \r\noccupied unvariably the same position corresponding \r\nto the minimum derivation of the green Hydrogen-line \r\nH[beta] i.e. of Fraunhofer\u2019s F. All spectra represented in the \r\nPlates are referred to to the three Hydrogen-lines H[alpha] \r\nH[beta] H[gamma] and the double Sodium lines Na. Generally two \r\nprisms of about 60[degree] and 45[degree] were employed, giving \r\nthe distances of H[alpha] and Na on one side and of H[gamma] \r\non the other side from H[beta] by the following numbers of \r\ndivisions of an arbitrary scale:\r\n139,6,  100,5 - 100, 88,5 [this is not a minus]\r\nIn the first plate portions of the whole coloured spectra \r\nare represented as they appear by making use of two \r\nadditional prisms of 45[degree].\r\nPlate I\r\ncontains spectra of the first order. The first spectrum \r\nN, belonging to Nitrogen is taken under such con \r\nditions that both<s>s<\\s> its extremities appear equally deve \r\nloped. To the whole spectrum is added a representation \r\nof two bands C of its more refracted part, obtained by means \r\nof the four prisms. Here a determined number of subtle \r\ndark transverse lines produce the channeled appearance.\r\n",
