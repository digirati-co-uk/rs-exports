At the \r\nordinary temperature it is rather too great \r\nto be measured, but, according to hitherto \r\nunknown laws, it rapidly decreases when \r\nthe temperature rises beyond that of red heat.\r\nThe law above mentioned is therefore not \r\nstrictly applicable in the case of gaseous \r\nconduction.\r\n11. Electricity can only be discharged through \r\na given stratum of air, from one point \r\nto another, after a certain electric tension \r\ntakes place in these points. This tension \r\ndepends upon the chemical constitution \r\nof the gas, and, the gas being the same,\r\nit is nearly in the ratio of its density and \r\nthe distance of the two points.
