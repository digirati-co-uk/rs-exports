I shall now insert \r\nthem here their bearing being in the same way as my \r\ndeficient observations.\r\nIn 5[degrees] <s>0<\\s>8\u2019 N. lat and 50[degrees] 28\u2019 W. long a distinct line of separation \r\nwas observed between the pure blue water of the ocean, and the \r\ndisco<s>u<\\s>loured water mixed with that from the Amazon river\r\nthe mouth of which was about 300 miles distant. The blue water \r\nhad a sp. gr. of 1,0262, which acording to my calculation (pag. 37) is = 33,672 p.m. salt \r\nwhile the water on the other side of the line of separation was 1,0204 = 26,345 p.m. salt \r\nfurther on under the influence of the river it was 1,0185 = 23,800 p.m. salt.\r\nBut the river water kept on the surface and in a depth of 126 feet \r\nthe sp. gr. was was 1,0262 (= 33,672 p.m. salt)\r\nIn 7[degrees] <s>0<\\s>1\u2019 N. lat and 52[degrees] 38\u2019,5 W. long the sp. gr. was 1,0245 = 31,905 p.m. salt \r\nand in 120 feet depth again 1,0262 sp. gr.\r\nIn 7[degrees] <s>05<\\s> lat and 53[degrees] 38\u2019,5 W. long the sp. gr. was 1,0245 = 31,905 p.m. salt\r\nIn the Gulf of Paria off the mouth of the Orinoco the sp.\r\ngr. was 1,0204 = 26,345 p.m. salt and in crossing one of the branches \r\nof the river itself the sp. gr. was found to be only 1,0064 =  8,234 p.m. sa[lt]\r\nsee, An Account of experiments to determine the figure of the Earth \r\nby Edw.
