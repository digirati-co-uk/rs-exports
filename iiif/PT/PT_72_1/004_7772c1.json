Our \r\ntubes, as represented by the diagram, (fig. 1)\r\ngenerally consist of a capillary middle \r\npart 30-40mm long and 1,5-2mm in dia \r\nmeter forming a narrow channel, by \r\nwhich two larger spheres with platinum \r\nelectrodes, traversing the glass, commu \r\nnicate with one another. The small \r\ntube starting from one of the spheres ser \r\nves to establish the communication \r\nwith the Exhaustor, to which it is either \r\nattached by means of a cement (sea\r\nling wax for instance) or soldered by \r\nthe blowpipe. The Exhaustor made solely of glass, without any metal, is con \r\nnected with an additional system of glass tubes and glass cocks, by \r\nmeans of which the spectral tube is \r\nmost easily filled w<s>h<\\s>ith the gas to be examined. If the gas be a permanent \r\none, the apparatus by which it is deve \r\nloped and its accessory parts, by which \r\nit is purified and dried, may <s>be<\\s> as well \r\nas the spectral tube, simultaneously \r\nand separately be evacuated. The gas \r\narrives directly from the apparatus \r\ninto the tube which <u>ad libitum<\\u> may be \r\nalternately filled and exhausted again ",
