Among the gases exhibiting the spectrum \r\nof vapour of carbon, when enclosed \r\nin our spectral tubes and decomposed \r\nby the heat of the discharge of Ruhm \r\nkorff\u2019s coil, we first select <u>oxide of car\r\nbon<\\u>. In operating with this gas as we \r\ndid with nitrogen, we got, if the Leyden \r\njar was intercalated, simultaneously \r\nthe spectrum of vapour of carbon and \r\nthe spectrum of oxygen, without the \r\njar, the pure spectrum of vapour of \r\ncarbon. In the last case the heat of \r\nthe discharge is high enough to ignite \r\nvapour of carbon, but not sufficient \r\nto give the spectrum of oxygen. The \r\nsingle spectrum as well as the combi \r\nned one is obtained accordingly <u>ad\r\nlibitum <\\u>, whence we conclude that the \r\nsuccessive discharges passing through the \r\nspectral tube, the gas is alternately de \r\ncomposed and recomposed again.\r\n50. We shall in few words describe the spec \r\ntrum obtained without the jar, at a \r\ntension of the gas - when observed by \r\nmeans of the manometer before the spec\r\ntral tube was sealed - of 32mm.\r\nFour characteristic groups only were\r\nseen: (a),(b)(c) and (d). When the current \r\nat first passed the band (a) appeared com \r\npletely; after some time its two first \r\nlines only remained, rising as isolated ",
