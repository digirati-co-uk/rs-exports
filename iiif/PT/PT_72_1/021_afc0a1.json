The \r\norange group slightly less refracted than \r\nNa is formed by four lines the second of \r\nwhich is the brightest, the third, not quite \r\nso bright, is closely followed by the fourth,\r\nwhich is very faint. The second yellow \r\ngroup contains seven lines among which \r\nthe fifth is brightest. The third light green \r\nand the fourth dark green group contain \r\neach nine lines. The 3d and 6th line of the \r\nlight green group and the 6th and 7th (both \r\nnear to each other) of the dark green group \r\nare brightest. The fifth light blue group (the \r\ndistance of its middle part from H[beta] and H[gamma]\r\nis about in the ratio of 3:4) is formed \r\nby six lines, the <s>fifth<\\s> <s>5th<\\s> second of which is the brightest \r\nthe <s>6th<\\s> first slightly less bright; the <s>first<\\s> last 4 lines,\r\nnearly equally distant from each other are \r\nslightly less bright again. Two groups \r\nof three fainter lines each fall between the \r\ntwo green groups and between the dark \r\ngreen and the blue. We may mention \r\nalso two bright single lines, placed out of \r\nthe groups, a green line preceeded by an ex \r\npanded one and a light violet line followed \r\nat a short distance by a bright band.
