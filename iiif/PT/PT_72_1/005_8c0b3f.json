In order to compare with one ano \r\nther the spectra corresponding to different \r\ndensities of the gas or even to a mixture \r\nof different gases, the tube may be exa \r\nmined by the Spectroscope while at \r\ntached to the Exhaustor. But generally \r\nthe spectral tube was blown off and her \r\nmetically sealed at the extremity of \r\nthe narrow tube, starting from one of \r\nthe spheres. This tube equally serves to \r\nattach the spectral tube before the slit \r\nof the Spectroscope.\r\n6. If the substance<s>s<\\s> submitted to exami \r\nnation were at the ordinary temperature \r\nin the liquid or solid condition, the tube \r\ndestined to receive it, was made of a \r\nglass difficultly <s>of <\\s> fusi<s>on<\\s>ble and bent as \r\nshown by the diagram (Fig 2).
