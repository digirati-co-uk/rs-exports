Tranns. 1838 \r\np. 63, it is said \u201cLet V stand for the \r\nintegral in the equation (7), and supposing \r\nthat p and T[squared] vary so as always to satisfy that \r\nequation, we shall have \r\ndV/[delta]p.dp + ddV/TdT = 0.\u201d \r\nNow the error alluded to consists in having \r\ngiven a wrong sign to the differential dV/TdT, \r\nthe value of which, as has been said, is \r\nmodified, in the question under conside:\r\nration, by the equation (7). This mistake \r\nvitiates the concluding part of the Paper, in \r\napp. 63, 64, 65, as far as relates to the li:\r\nmits of <s>variables<\\s> the quantities p and T[squared]. M. Lionsville \r\nhas done the author of the Paper the honour \r\nof noticing and correcting the mistake in his <u>Journal\r\nde Math.ques for April 1839<\\u>. When the sign of \r\nthe differential is rightly ascertained, \r\nthe analysis pursued in the Paper leads \r\nto a simple determination of the limits \r\nsought, as this Note will prove, the pro:\r\npriety of printing which in the Phil. Transns. \r\nis submitted to the Council.\r\n",
