Now, for all values of \r\np between p[squared] and 3, dV/[delta]p is negative: wherefore \r\nthe same function will continue to be \r\nnegative in the equation (A) for all values of p and T[squared]: and \r\nas dV/[delta]p.dp is also negative, dp must be \r\npositive, so that p will increase above \r\np [squared] without limit.\r\nIf the sign of [delta]V/dp be changed, the re:\r\nsult will be positive: and hence, observing \r\nthat x is contained between 0 and 1, we ob:\r\ntain a condition between any two values \r\nof p and T[squared] that satisfy the equation (7), \r\nnamely ",
