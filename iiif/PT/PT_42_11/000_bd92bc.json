Read -\r\nThe Salpae, those strange gelatinous animals,\r\nthrough masses of which the voyager in the \r\ngreat ocean sometimes sails day after day -\r\nhave been the subject of great controversy \r\nsince the time of the publication of the celebrated \r\nwork of Chamisso \u201cDe animalibus quibusdam \r\ne classe Vermium Linnaeana \u201c -\r\nIn this work were set forth, for the first \r\ntime the <s>strange <\\s> singular phenomena presented by \r\nthe reproductive Inocenes of these animals:-\r\nphenomena so strange, and so utterly unlike \r\nanything then known to occur in the whole \r\nprovince of Zoology, that Chamisso\u2019s admirably \r\nclear and faithful account, was received \r\nwith almost as much distrust as if he had \r\nannounced the existence of a veritable Peter Schleinkl.\r\nIn later days an opposite fate has fallen upon \r\nthe <s>theory <\\s> statements in question. They have been made the \r\nkeystone of a <s>new <\\s> revived* theory, and the phenomena \r\npresented by the Salpae have been cited as \u2018plainly \r\ninstances \u2018 of a law governing the vast majority \r\nof the lower Invertebrata - the law of the \u201cAlternation \r\nof Generations \u201c\r\n* not new. see 5.",
