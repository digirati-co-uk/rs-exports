Milne Edwards has clearly \r\nshewn in Clavelina consists of three tunics - an outer \r\n- the <u>Test<\\u> - a middle - which is here called outer <u>tunic <\\u> and \r\nan inner - the inner <\\u>tunic<\\u> - The inner tunic of the \r\nsalpa answers to the inner tunic of clavelina but \r\nits outer tunic answers to the test and the outer <u>tunic <\\u> together ",
