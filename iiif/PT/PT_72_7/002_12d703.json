From these considerations Professor W. Thom[son] \r\nhas argued*, that the medium must have a density capable of \r\ncomparison with that of gross matter, and has even \r\nassigned an inferior limit to that density. \r\n\r\n*\u201cOn the Possible Density of the Luminiferous Medium and On the Mechanical Yalue of a Cubic Mile of Sunlight \r\nTransactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1854) p 57.
