Let E be the intrinsic energy of the field surrounding two gravitating \r\nbodies M<sub>1<\\sub>M<sub>2<\\sub> and let E' be the intrinsic energy of the field surrounding \r\ntwo magnetic poles m<sub>1<\\sub>m<sub>2<\\sub> <s>proportional<\\s> equal in numerical value to \r\nM<sub>1<\\sub>M<sub>2<\\sub> and let X be that gravitating force during the displacement [delta]x \r\nand X' the magnetic force \r\nX[delta]x = [delta]E x'[delta]x = [delta]E' \r\nNow X and  X' are equal in numerical value but of opposite signs \r\nso that [delta]E = - [delta]E' \r\nor E = C - E' \r\n= C - [capital sigma]1/8[pi]([alpha]<sup>2<\\sup> + [beta]<sup>2<\\sup> + [gamma]<sup>2<\\sup>)dV \r\nwhere [alpha] [beta] [gamma] are the components of magnetic intensity. If R be the \r\nresultant gravitating force and R' the resultant magnetic force at a \r\ncorresponding part of the field. R - R' and \r\n[alpha]<sup>2<\\sup> + [beta]<sup>2<\\sup> + [gamma]<sup>2<\\sup> = R<sup>2<\\sup> = R'<sup>2<\\sup> \r\nHence E = C = [capital sigma]1/8[pi] R<sup>2<\\sup> dV  47 \r\nThe intrinsic energy of the field of gravitation must therefore be \r\n<s>diminished<\\s> less wherever there is a resultant gravitating force \r\n",
