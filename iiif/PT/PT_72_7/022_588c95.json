The heating effect of the current, and the impulse it \r\ngives to the suspended coil of Weber's dynamometer depend on \r\nthe square of the current at every instant during the short time it lasts \r\n\r\nHence we must obtain the solution of the equations and \r\nfrom the solution we may find the effects both on the galvanometer \r\nand dynamometer and we may then make use of the method of Weber ",
