As we do not propose to \r\ngive a complete investigation of the question in the present \r\nimperfect state of the theory as extended to disturbances of short \r\nperiod, we shall assume that the axes of magnetic induction \r\ncoincide in direction with those of electric elasticity. <s> and that \r\n(as in the case of an isotropic medium) the terms including [psi] have \r\nnothing to do with the result.<\\s> \r\n\r\n(103) Let the values of the magnetic coefficient for the three axes be [lambda], [mu], [nu], \r\nthen the equations of magnetic force (b) become \r\n[lambda][alpha] = dH/dy - dG/dz \r\n[mu][beta] = dF/dz - dH/dx \r\n[nu][gamma] = dG/dx - dF/dy }(81) \r\n\r\nThe equations of electric currents (C) remain as before \r\nThe equations of electric elasticity (E) will be \r\nP = 4[pi]a<sup>2<\\sup>f \r\nQ = 4[pi]b<sup>2<\\sup>y \r\nR = e[pi]c<sup>2<\\sup>h } (82) \r\nwhere 4[pi]a<sup>2<\\sup>, 4[pi]b<sup>2<\\sup>, 4[pi]c<sup>2<\\sup> are the values of k for the <s>different<\\s> axes of x, y, z \r\nCombining these equations with (A) and (D) we get equations of the form \r\n1/[mu][nu]([lambda] d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dx<sup>2<\\sup> + [mu]d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dy<sup>2<\\sup> + [nu]d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dz<sup>2<\\sup>) - 1/[mu][nu] d/dx([lambda] dF/dx + [mu]dG/dy + [nu]dH/dz) = 1/d<sup>2<\\sup> (d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dt<sup>2<\\sup> + d<sup>2<\\sup>[psi]/dxdt) (83) \r\n\r\n(104) If l m n are the direction - cosines of the wave and V its velocity \r\nand if lk + my + nz - Vt = w (84) \r\nthen F G H & [psi] will be functions of w and if we put F' G' H' [psi]' for \r\nthe second differentials of these quantities with respect to w, <s>then<\\s> the equations \r\nwill be \r\n",
