In the case of two conducting circuits A and B we shall assume \r\nthat the electromagnetic momentum belonging to A is \r\nLx + My \r\nand that belonging to B, Mx + Ny \r\nwhere L M N correspond to the same quantities in the dynamical \r\nillustration except that they are supposed to be capable of variation \r\n<s>according<\\s> when the conductors A or B are moved. \r\nThen the equation of the current x in A will be \r\n[xi] = Rx + d/dt(Lx + My)  (4) \r\nand that of y in B [eta] = Sy + d/dt(Mx + Ny) (5) \r\nwhere [xi] and [eta] are the electromotive forces x and y the currents \r\nand R & S the resistances in A and B respectively. \r\n\r\nInduction of one Current by another \r\n\r\n(29) Case 1<sup>st<\\sup> Let there be no electromotive force on B except that which arises \r\nfrom the action of A, and let the current of A increase from 0 to the \r\nvalue x then Sy + d/dt(Mx + Ny) = 0 \r\nwhence Y =[integral]ydt = - M/S x <s>(6)<\\s> \r\nthat is a quantity of electricity Y being the total induced current \r\nwill flow through B when x rises from 0 to x.
