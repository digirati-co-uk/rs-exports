If we were to go beyond our experimental \r\nknowledge and to assign a definite density to a substance which \r\nwe should call the elastic fluid and select either <s>positive<\\s> vitreous or <s>negative<\\s> resinous \r\nelectricity as the representative of that fluid, then we might \r\nhave normal vibrations propagated with a velocity depending on \r\nthis density. We have however no evidence as to the density of electricity \r\nas we do not know whether to consider vitreous electricity as \r\na substance or the absence of a substance. \r\n\r\nHence electromagnetic science leads to exactly the same \r\nconclusions as optical science with respect to the <s>nature<\\s> direction \r\nof the disturbances which can be propagated through the field, \r\n<s>each<\\s> both affirm the propagation of transverse vibrations and both \r\n[indicate/present?] the same velocity of propagation. On the other hand \r\nboth sciences are at a loss when called on to affirm or deny \r\nthe existence of normal vibrations. \r\n\r\n(101) Relation between the Index of Refraction and the electromagnetic \r\ncharacter of the substance \r\n\r\nThe velocity of light in a medium according to the Undulating \r\nTheory is 1/i V<sub>0<\\sub> \r\nwhere i is the index of refraction and V<sub>0<\\sub> is the velocity in vacuum \r\nThe velocity according to the electromagnetic theory is \r\n[square root]k/4[pi][mu] \r\nwhere k = 1/D k<sub>0<\\sub> and k<sub>0 = 4[pi]V<sub>0<\\sub><sup>2<\\sup> \r\nHence D = i<sup>2<\\sup>/[mu] (80) \r\nor the <s>refr Index<\\s> Specific Inductive Capacity is equal to the \r\nsquare of the index of refraction divided by the coefficient of \r\nmagnetic induction ",
