When there are no \r\ncurrents in the field this quantity has a single value for each \r\npoint. When there are currents, the <s>function<\\s> -potential \r\nhas a series of values at each point, but its differential coefficients \r\nhave only one value, namely \r\nd[phi]/dx = [alpha] d[phi]/dy=[beta] d[phi]/dz=[gamma] \r\nSubstituting these values of [alpha] [beta] [gamma] in the expression (Eq<sup>n 38) \r\nfor the intrinsic energy of the field, and integrating by parts \r\nit becomes -[capital sigma]{[phi]1/8[pi] (d[mu][alpha]/dx + d[mu][beta]/dy + d[mu][gamma]/dz)}dV \r\n<s>Now<\\s> The expression \r\n[capital sigma](d[mu][alpha]/dx + d[mu][beta]/dy + d[mu][gamma]/dz)}dV = [capital sigma]mdV (39) \r\nindicates the number of lines of magnetic force which have their \r\norigin within the space V. Now a magnetic pole is known to \r\nus only as the origin or termination of lines of magnetic \r\nforce, and a unit pole is one which has  4[pi] lines belonging \r\nto it since it produces unit of magnetic intensity at unit of \r\ndistance over a sphere whose surface is 4[pi]. \r\nHence if m is the amount of free positive magnetism in \r\nunit of volume, the above expression may be written 4[pi]m \r\nand the expression for the energy of the field becomes \r\nE = -[capital sigma]([half][phi]m)dV (40) \r\nIf there are two magnetic poles m<sub>1 <\\sub> and m<sub>2<\\sub> producing \r\npotentials [phi]<sub>1<\\sub> & [phi<sub>2<\\sub> in the field, then if m<sub>2<\\sub> is moved a distance \r\n",
