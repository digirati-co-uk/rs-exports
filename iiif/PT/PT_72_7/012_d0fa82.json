The want of uniformity of the current \r\nin the different parts of the section of a wire at the commencement of the \r\ncurrent is investigated, I believe for the first time, and the consequent \r\ncorrection of the coefficient of self induction is found. \r\n\r\nThese results are applied to the calculation. of the self induction of \r\nthe coil used in the experiments of the Committee of the British Association on Standards \r\nof Electric Resistance and the value compared with that deduced from \r\nthe experiments. \r\n",
