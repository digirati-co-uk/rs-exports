Hence the left hand side \r\nof the equation represents the work done by the electromotive forces \r\nin unit of time. \r\n\r\n<u>Heat produced by the Current<\\u> \r\n\r\n(32) On the other side of the equation we have first \r\nRx<sup>2<\\sup> + Sy<sup>2<\\sup> = H (9) \r\nwhich represents the work done in overcoming the resistance \r\nof the circuits in unit of time. This is converted into Heat. \r\nThe remaining terms represent work not converted into heat \r\nThey may be written \r\n\r\n[formula] \r\n\r\nIntrinsic Energy of the Currents. \r\n\r\n(33) If L, M, N are constant, the whole work of the electromotive \r\nforces which is not spent against resistance will be devoted to \r\nthe development of the currents The whole intrinsic energy \r\nof the currents is therefore \r\n[half] Lx<sup>2<\\sup> + Mxy + [half]Ny<sup>2<\\sup> = E (10) \r\nThis energy exists in a form imperceptible to our senses \r\nprobably as actual motion, the seat of this motion being not \r\nmerely the conducting circuits but the space surrounding them \r\n\r\nMechanical Action between conductors \r\n(34) The remaining terms \r\n[half]dL/dtx<sup>2<\\sup> + dM/dtxy + [half]dN/dty<sup>2<\\sup> = W (11)\r\n\r\nare the work done in unit of time arising from the variations \r\nof L M & N, or what is the same thing alterations in the form \r\nand position of the conducting circuits A and B.
