The work done by a variable electromotive \r\nforce, P, in producing a variable displacement, f, is got \r\nby integrating [integral]Pdf \r\nfrom P=0 to the given value of P. \r\nSince P=kf eq<sup>n<\\sup> (E) this quantity becomes \r\n[integral] kfdf = [half]kf<sup>2<\\sup> = [half]Pf \r\nHence the intrinsic energy of any part of the field, as existing \r\nin the form of electric displacement is \r\n<s>[capital sigma] k/2(f<sup>2<\\sup> + g<sup>2<\\sup> + h<sup>2<\\sup>)[delta]V<s> \r\n[half][capital sigma](Pf + Qg + Rh)dV \r\nThe total energy existing in the field is therefore \r\nE = [capital sigma]{1/8[pi]([alpha][mu][alpha] + [beta][mu][beta] + [gamma][mu][gamma]) + [half](Pf + Qg + Rh)}dV (I) \r\nThe first term of this expression depends on the magnetization \r\nof the field and is explained on our theory by actual motion \r\nof some kind. The second term depends on the electric \r\npolarization of the field and is explained on our theory \r\nby strain of some kind in an elastic medium. \r\n(73) I have on a former occasion* attempted to describe a particu[lar] \r\nkind f motion and a particular kind of strain so arranged \r\nas to account for the phenomena.
