Calculation of the Coefficients of Electromagnetic Induction \r\nGeneral Methods \r\n\r\n(109) The Electromagnetic relations between two conducting circuits \r\nA and B depend upon a function M of their form and relative \r\nposition as has already been shown \r\nM may be calculated in several different ways, which must \r\nof course all lead to the same result \r\n1<sup>st<\\sup> method. M is the electromagnetic momentum of the circuit \r\nB when A carries a unit current or \r\nM = [integral](F dx/ds' + G dy/ds' + H dz/ds') ds' \r\nwhere F, G, H are the components of electromagnetic momentum \r\ndue to a unit current in A and ds' is an element of length \r\nof B and the integration is performed round the circuit of B \r\nTo find F G H we observe that by (B) and (C) \r\nd<sup>2<\\sup>F/dx<sup>2<\\sup> + d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dy<sup>2<\\sup> + d<sup>2<\\sup>F/dz<sup>2<\\sup> = - 4[pi][mu]p' \r\nwith corresponding equations for G & H, p' q' & r' being the \r\ncomponents of the current in A \r\nNow if we consider only a single element ds of A we shall have \r\np' = dx/ds ds q' = dy/ds ds r' = dz/ds ds \r\nand the solution of the equation gives \r\nF = [mu]/[rho] dx/ds ds G = [mu]/[rho] dy/ds ds H = [mu]/[rho] dz/ds ds \r\nwhere [rho] is the distance of any point from ds.
