                "chars": "The case of a condenser composed of parallel layers of substances \r\nof different electric resistances and inductive capacities is next examined \r\nand it is shown that the phenomenon called electric absorption \r\nwill generally occur, that is, the condenser, when suddenly discharged, will \r\nafter a short time show signs of a <u>residual<\\u>  charge. \r\n\r\n(20) The general equations are next applied to the case of a magnetic \r\ndisturbance propagated through a non conducting field, and it is \r\nshown that the only disturbances which can be so propagated \r\nare those which are transverse to the direction of propagation, \r\nand that the velocity of propagation is the velocity v, found from experiments \r\nsuch as those of Weber which expresses the number of electrostatic units \r\nof electricity which are contained in one electromagnetic unit. \r\nThis velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong \r\nreason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other radia \r\nradiations if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves \r\npropagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic \r\nlaws. If so, the agreement between the elasticity of the medium \r\nas calculated from the rapid alternations of <s>a<\\s> luminous vibrations \r\nand as found by the slow processes of electrical experiments, shows \r\nhow perfect and regular the elastic properties of the medium must be \r\nwhen not encumbered with any matter grosser than air. If the same \r\ncharacter of the elasticity is retained in dense transparent bodies, it appears \r\nthat the square of the index of refraction is equal to the product \r\nof the specific dielectric capacity and the specific magnetic capacity. \r\nConducting media are shown to absorb such radiations rapidly \r\nand therefore to be generally opaque. \r\n\r\nThe conception of the propagation of transverse magnetic disturbances \r\nto the exclusion of normal ones is distinctly set forth by Professor \r\nFaraday* in his \u201cThoughts on Ray Vibrations\u201d The electromagnetic \r\ntheory of light as proposed by him is the same in substance as that \r\nwhich I have begun to develope in this paper except that in 1846 \r\nthere were no data to calculate the velocity of <s>[text?]<\\s> propagation. \r\n*Phil.
