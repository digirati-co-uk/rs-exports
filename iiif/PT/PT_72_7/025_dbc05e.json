One pair, AC of these \r\npoints is connected through the battery, B. The opposite pair DE \r\nis connected through the galvanometer G. Then if the resistances \r\nof the four conductors are represented by P Q R S, and the currents \r\nin them by x, x-z, y and y+z the current through G being z. \r\nLet the potantials at the four points be A C D E. Then the conditions \r\nof steady currents may be found from the equations \r\nPx = A - D Q(x - z) = D - C \r\nRy = A - E S(y + z) = E - C \r\nGz = D - E B(x + y) = -A + C + F (21) \r\nSolving these equations for z we find \r\n<s>Z{1/P + 1/Q + 1/R + 1/S + G(1/P + 1/G)(1/R + 1/S)} = B(1/PS - 1/QR) \r\nIf PS = QR then z = 0 <\\s> \r\nZ{1/P + 1/Q + 1/R + 1/S + B(1/P + 1/R)(1/Q + 1/S) + G(1/P + 1/Q)(1/R + 1/S) + BG/PQRS(P + Q + R + S)} = F(1/PS - 1/QR) (22) \r\n<s>If PS = QR then z = 0 <\\s> In this expression F is the electromotive force of the battery z the <s>consta<\\s> \r\ncurrent through the galvanometer when it has become steady. \r\nP Q R S the resistances in the four arms.
