Such a mechanism must be subject to \r\nthe general laws of Dynamics, and we ought to be able to \r\nwork out all the consequences of its motion, provided we \r\nknow the form of the relation between the motions of the \r\nparts. \r\n\r\n*As for instance the composition of glue treacle &c of which small plastic figures are \r\nmade, which after being distorted gradually recover their shape.",
