The electric balance therefore affords the means \r\nof measuring the self induction of any circuit whose \r\nresistance is known \r\n\r\n(46) It may also be used to determine the coefficient of induction \r\nbetween two circuits as for instance, m, but it would be more convenient to measure this by directly \r\nmeasuring the current as in (37) without  using the balance \r\nWe may also ascertain the equality of p/P and q/Q by there being no \r\n",
