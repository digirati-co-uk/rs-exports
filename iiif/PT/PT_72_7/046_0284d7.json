Then the increment of the electromagnetic momentum \r\ndue to the motion of a will be \r\na(dF/dx dx/ds + dG/dx dy/ds + dH/dx dz/ds) [delta]x \r\nThat due to the lengthening of the circuit by increasing the length of \r\nthe parallel conductors will be \r\n-a(dF/dx dx/ds + dF/dy dy/ds + dF/dz dz/ds) [delta]x \r\nThe total increment is a[delta]x{dy/ds(dG/dx - dF/dy) - dz/ds(dF/dz -dH/dx)} \r\nwhich is by the equations of Magnetic force, (B). \r\na[delta]x(y/ds [mu][gamma] - dz/ds [mu][beta]) \r\nLet X be the force acting along the direction of x per unit of length \r\nof the conductor then the work done is Xa[delta]x Let C be the current in the conductor and let p' q' r' be its \r\ncomponents then \r\nXa[delta]x = ca[delta]x(dy/ds [mu][gamma] - dz/ds [mu][beta]) \r\nor X = [mu][gamma]q' - [mu]beta]r' \r\nSimilarly Y = [mu][alpha]r' - [mu][gamma]p' \r\nz = [mu]beta]p' - [mu][alpha]q' (J) \r\nThese are the equations which determine the mechanical force \r\nacting on a conductor carrying a current. The force is perpendicular \r\nto the current and to the lines of force, and is measured by the area \r\nof the parallelogram formed by lines parallel to the current & lines of force \r\nand proportional to their intensities ",
