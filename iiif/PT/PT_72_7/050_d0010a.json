The electrostatic system of measurement \r\nis founded on the mechanical action between electrified bodies \r\nand is independent of, and incompatible with the electromagnetic \r\nsystem, so that the units of the different kinds of quantity \r\nhave different values according to the system we adopt, and \r\nto pass from one system to the other, a reduction of \r\nall the quantities is required. \r\n\r\nAccording to the electrostatic system, the repulsion \r\nbetween two small bodies charged with quantities y<sub>1<\\sub>y<sub>2<\\sub> of \r\nelectricity is  y<sub>1y<sub>2<\\sub>/r<sup>2<\\sup> \r\nwhere r is the distance between them \r\nLet the relation of the two systems be such that one \r\nelectromagnetic unit of electricity contains v electrostatic \r\nunits then e<sub>1<\\sub> = vy<sub>1<\\sub> and e<sub>2<\\sub> = vy<sub>2<\\sub> \r\nand k/4[pi] e<sub>1<\\sub>e<sub2<\\sub>/r<sup>2<\\sup> = v<sup>2<\\sup> e<sub>1<\\sub>e<sub2<\\sub>/r<sup>2<\\sup> (45) \r\nwhence k the coefficient of \"electric elasticity\" in the medium \r\nin which the experiments are made i.e. common air, is \r\nrelated to v the number of electrostatic units in one \r\nelectromagnetic unit, by the equation \r\nk = 4[pi]v<sup>2<\\sup> (46) \r\nThe quantity v may be determined by experiment in several ways \r\nAccording to the experiments of M.M.
