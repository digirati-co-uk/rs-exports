It is\r\nunnecessary to give it\r\nhere, as all the\r\nessentials are contained\r\nin the table which has just been exhibited.\r\n     The application of this number to the logarithm of the\r\nmean Rate of the Detached Pendulum upon the Clock\r\nPendulum under the actual circumstances gave the\r\nlogarithm of mean Rate of the Detached Pendulum\r\nupon the Clock Pendulum, supposing the arc of\r\nvibration of the Detached Pendulum to have been indefinitely\r\nsmall.\r\n     The Commencing and Concluding Arcs which were used as\r\nArguments for the table, were those corresponding to the means of\r\nthe coincidences retained at the beginning and at the end of the Swing.",
