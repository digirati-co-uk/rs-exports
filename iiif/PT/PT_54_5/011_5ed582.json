MD. and by the local knowledge of James Mather\r\nEsq, I had little difficulty <s>of</s> in fixing on a\r\nmine. The deepest mines in the Durham coalfield\r\nare near the coast. The deepest of all is the\r\nMonk Wearmouth colliery; but it is to close to\r\nthe sea (its workings in fact extending far under\r\nthe sea) that it seemed probable that <s>[?]</s> more of\r\ndisadvantage would be introduced by the\r\ncomplication of the elements of final computations\r\nthan of advantage by its extreme depth. The\r\nnext in depth, I believe, is the Harton Pit,\r\nat the distance of somewhat more than two miles\r\nfrom South Shields, and about the same\r\ndistance from the coast. The general circumstances\r\nof form of surface &c are as favourable as can usually\r\nbe found. Its depth is reputed to be 1260 feet. On making known to William Anderson\r\nEsq. the principal owner of the coalmine, my wish\r\nto try the experiment in that <s>mine</s> place, I was at once\r\nassured that every assistance should be given to me.\r\nIn company with C.W. Anderson Esq. and with G.W. Arkley Esq.",
