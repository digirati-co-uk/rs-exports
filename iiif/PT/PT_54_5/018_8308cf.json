On\r\nmounting them at the Royal Observatory, it was found\r\nthat they touched the agate planes <s>only</s> only in <s>[?]</s> a few\r\npoints; and the singularity of the mode of contact\r\nreminded me so strongly of the contact in Cornwall in\r\n1828 that I do not doubt that one pendulum was the\r\nsame and affected by the same  faults.
