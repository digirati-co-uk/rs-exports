The range of the Intervals of Coincidences in\r\nthese experiments is not indicated in the tables given in \r\nSection III. The table of log n-2/n <s>[?]</s> which is\r\nplaced below includes all that are required here. The\r\nmethod of using it is the same as in the preceding Series.\r\n     The tables used before for the Correction for Arc were\r\nsufficient for the present experiments.\r\n\r\nThe range of temperature in the experiments now\r\nmade greatly exceeded that for the experiments in the mine.\r\nIn extending a table, so as to include an increased range\r\nof physical conditions, there will always be some doubt\r\nas to the propriety of selection of that mathematical\r\nfunction which is assumed to increase proportionally with\r\nthe indications of the physical measurer. I have here\r\nassumed that the changes of the logarithms of the\r\ntemperature-correction are simply proportional to the changes\r\nof thermometer-reading. The table below, therefore, is formed\r\nfrom the table in Section III by simple addition and subtraction\r\nof <s>equal</s> a constant number.\r\nThe table used for barometrical correction is the same which\r\nwas used before.",
