R<sup>3</sup>D/R<sup>2</sup> = 4\u03c0/3 . RD  : and the attraction at the external\r\nsurface of the shell is represented by 4\u03c0.R<sup>3</sup>D + ((R+c)<sup>3</sup> - R<sup>3</sup>)d / 3(R+c)<sup>2</sup>,\r\nwhich to the first power of c/R is 4\u03c0.RD/3 .(1 - 2c/R + 3c.d/R.D)\r\nCalling the gravity at those two points respectively G\r\nand g, g/G = 1 - 2c/R + 3c.d/R.D , from which <s>D/d</s> d/D =\r\nR.g/3c.G - (R/3c - 2/3).
