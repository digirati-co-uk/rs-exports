The chimney-\r\nopening and other crevices were carefully stopped up,\r\nand a hot-air-stove with funnel leading into the\r\nchimney was planted in the room: by means of this\r\nstove the temperature of the room could be maintained\r\nwith reasonable steadiness nearly to 90<sup>o</sup> Fahrenheite.\r\nThe pendulum 8 with Clock Earnshaw were\r\nmounted in the usual way in this room. A screen\r\nwas placed between the stove and the pendulum,\r\nwhich effectively prevented the pendulum and its thermometer from\r\nreceiving any sensible heat by radiation. The\r\nother room is the Lower Record Room, a room\r\nwith stone floor laid (except at its center) upon the solid ground,\r\n<s>[?]</s> warmed by a heating apparatus below\r\nthe <s>floor</s> center of the floor.
