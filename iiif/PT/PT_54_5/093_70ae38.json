I found that\r\na line might be drawn nearly 10 depths distant from <s>[?]</s> the upper\r\nstation, touching the cliffs of Tynemouth and the cliffs south\r\n-east of Harton, and ranging for some distance along the coast\r\nof Durham. I therefore drew a line parallel to this at\r\n10 depths distance from the upper station: and divided the\r\nwhole country into squares (with sides of one depth each) whose sides were parallel and\r\nperpendicular to this. These squares I grouped as appeared\r\nmost convenient as will be seen in the Map, figure 4 (the principal object being to secure a\r\nproper representation of Jarrow Slake and the Valley\r\nof the Tyne), and adopted for each group the elevation\r\nin feet above high water which <s>[?]</s> Mr. Thompson's\r\nelevations of special points suggested. <s>[?]</s> The\r\n<s>[?]</s> elevation of the upper pendulum station was\r\n74 feet. Consequently the <s>[?]</s> vertical measure\r\nwhich was to be used for computing the \"volume\" in the\r\nformula above was [Elevation - 74]/1256. Of this formula,\r\na small table was prepared. The quantity p was measured graphically\r\nfrom the map, and \u221a[p<sup>2</sup> + 1] was formed graphically from it.",
