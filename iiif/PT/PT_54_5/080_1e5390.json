Measure of the difference of level\r\n     of the two pendulum-Stations: survey of the\r\n     neighbouring country: and computation of the\r\n     difference of attraction of the Earth's shell on the two\r\n     pendulums, upon an assumed value of density.\r\n\r\n49. For measuring the depth of the mine, Mr. Simms furnished an iron wire 100 feet long with an attached\r\nscale at each end. After the operation, this wire\r\nwas returned to Mr. Simms, and was found to have\r\npreserved its length sensibly unaltered. It was\r\nused by Mr. Arkley to measure the depth, in the\r\nfollowing manner. Mr. Arkley placed himself on\r\nthe <s>[?]</s> top of the \"Cage\" in which the coal trams are\r\nconveyed from the bottom <s>[?]</s> of the shaft to the\r\ntop, and, when it was lowered 100 feet, an Assistant\r\nattached himself to the strong wire-rope on which\r\n<s>[?]</s> the cage is suspended. The Assistant carried the upper end\r\nof the measuring-wire, and in the first instance\r\nheld it level with the top of the shaft (the steam\r\nengine used for raising or lowering the cage being stopped): Mr. Arkley noted the position",
