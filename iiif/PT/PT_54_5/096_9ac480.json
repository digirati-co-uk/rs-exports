By the kindness of Mr. Arkley, I was furnished\r\nwith a complete account of the strata passed through in sinking\r\nthe Harton shaft, and with specimens of a great number of\r\nthe rocks. These were submitted to Professor W.H. Miller,\r\nwho with great labour determined their specific gravities.\r\nI place below the entire catalogue and measure of the\r\nstrata, and the results at which Professor Miller arrived.\r\nProfessor Miller remarks that there is inevitable uncertainty\r\nin the estimation of the weight of those specimens which\r\ndrawn from beds described as containing water.\r\n\r\n[Table of specific gravities not transcribed - Samples No. 1 -15]",
