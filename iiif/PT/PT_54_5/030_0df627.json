I have already alluded to the\r\nextensive works constructed by the owners of the\r\nHarton Colliery, and which they made entirely\r\nat their own expense: and to the liberality of\r\nthe Electric Telegraph Company, who gratuitously\r\ngave me their important assistance in the galvanic\r\nconnexions. In transmitting the instruments from\r\nthe wharfs at Newcastle to South Shields, Messrs.\r\nStevenson & Co. of the Jarrow Chemical Works gave the\r\nuse of their river craft. The Mayor and Corporation of South Shields, unsolicited, caused the swings to be\r\nmade which were needed for computaton of the attraction of the ground. Some parts of the\r\napparatus (galvanometers, wires, stoves &c,) were\r\nso evidently applicable to the prospective wants of the Royal\r\nObservatory that they were not considered as a charge\r\non the experiment. The Lords Commissioners of the\r\nAdmiralty, on my laying before them my proposals,\r\ncontributed \u00a3100 <s>for</s> which defrayed the greater part of the miscellaneous\r\nexpenses. The residual charges were borne by\r\nmyself.",
