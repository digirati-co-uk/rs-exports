General<s>y</s> System of observing the\r\nPendulums and reducing the observations.\r\n\r\n<s>31</s>29. <s>La</s> Before describing the observations &c, I will\r\nremark that the pendulums above and below were\r\nmounted in exactly the same manner. Each angle\r\nof the iron stand, in each station, rested on a\r\nsingle brick: and great care was taken by Mr. Dunkin\r\nthat the bearing of these bricks should be perfectly solid.\r\nIt was also a subject of Mr. Dunkin's special\r\nattention to make the supplementary hexagonal\r\niron frame (<s>to</s> which I have described in article\r\n15) quite firm; and, above all, to fix firmly\r\nat the beginning of each series and to examine\r\ncarefully at the end of each series the frame carrying\r\nthe agate planes. In every instance there were\r\nfound perfectly <s>[?]</s> firm in their <s>[?]</s> attachment.\r\nAt every interchange of pendulums Mr. Dunkin carefully oiled and wiped the knife-\r\nedges and their agate planes. At the beginning of every Swing, the observer raised the knife-edge\r\nfrom contact <s>by</s> with the agate plane, <s>[?]</s> by the screw lifting apparatus, and then carried it gently to a\r\ndefinite line of bearing.\r\n<s>32</s>30.
