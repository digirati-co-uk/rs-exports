The number given by this table is the logarithm of\r\nthe mean rate of the Detached Pendulum upon the Clock\r\nPendulum under the actual circumstances of observation.\r\nIt is next required to investigate the correction to this\r\nlogarithm depending on the <s>[?]</s> extent of the arc of\r\nvibration: on  of the conditions of the data of he problem\r\nbeing, that the <s>center of the</s> arc is observed only at\r\nthe beginning and the end of the Swing.\r\n     In the first place, to <s>[?]</s> compute the correction\r\nto the logarithm, supposing the arc of vibration constant.\r\nLet the whole arc of vibration, as seen upon the\r\nscale of inches, be I. For the pendulum 1821,\r\nsuppose the scale to be placed 1 inch behind the\r\npendulum, and for the pendulum 8, 1.8 inch\r\nbehind the pendulum. <s>[?]</s>\r\n<s>[?]</s> And suppose the distance\r\nof the object glass of the observing telescope to be 100 inches.\r\nThen the real whole arc of vibration is I x 100/101 for pendulum 1821\r\nand I x 100/101.8 for pendulum 8. The lengths of\r\nthe two pendulums, from the knife-edge to the indicating\r\npoint of the tail, are respectively 60.7 and 60.2 inches.\r\nHence the proportion of the real whole arc of vibration to\r\nthe length of the pendulum is I x 100/101 x 60.7 for pendulum 1821",
