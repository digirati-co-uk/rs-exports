For S, <s>[?]</s> the number which we have found for E<sub>0</sub> contains\r\n26.25/2.27 .A or 12A nearly: and as the probable error\r\nof A is about 1/40 .e, the probable error of 12A is\r\nabout 3/10 .e: and therefore we have on the right side of the\r\nequation an aggregate of terms whose probable error is\r\n\u221ae<sup>2</sup> + 9/100 .e<sup>2</sup> or \r\ne(1 + 1/22) nearly. The same is true for\r\nE<sub>26</sub> and those near it. Bu for E<sub>43</sub> the factor of A is 0.\r\nThus it will easily be seen that the quantity which we\r\nobtain is really e(1 + 1/66) nearly. The correction scarcely\r\ndeserves notice.\r\n44. In this manner the following (uncorrected) values of\r\nE<sub>0</sub>, E<sub>1</sub>, &c, are found: arranged with reference to the\r\nSwings to which they relate.
