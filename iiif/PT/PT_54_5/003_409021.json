When other elements of calculation are\r\nexamined, as the general simplicity in the form of the\r\nground for the mine-experiment and the complexity\r\nfor the mountain-experiment, the accurate knowledge\r\nof the geology for the mine-experiment and the obscurity\r\nfor the mountain-experiment, the difference became\r\nstill more striking in favour of the mine-experiment as\r\ncompared with that <s>on</s> of Schehallien.\r\n4. In a subsequent section, means will be given\r\nfor enabling the reader to judge whether an accuracy\r\nlike 0.1 vibrations per day in the difference of the rates\r\nof pendulums above and below, in the mine-experiment,\r\nhas really been obtained.
