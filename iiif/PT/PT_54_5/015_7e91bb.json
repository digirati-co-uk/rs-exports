The\r\nshaft is divided from top to bottom by a wooden\r\npartition or brattice. At every 100 feet in the\r\ndescent, a wooden peg about 6 inches long and\r\n2 inches in diameter was fixed in the <s>brattice</s>\r\nbrattice. The galvanic wires were wrapped\r\naround this peg, and more pinched fast by a piece\r\nof wood which was screwed to the peg. In this\r\nmanner the wires were held perfectly steady,\r\nand no part was strained by an excessive weight\r\nhanging upon them. On reaching the bottom of the\r\n<s>shaft</s> shaft, the<s>y</s> wires were carried horizontally along\r\nalong the top of the galleries, protected by boards of\r\nwood, till they entered the lower station. The\r\nlabour of Telegraph Engineers, which was required\r\nfor fixing these wires and for other adjustments of\r\nthe galvanic apparatus, was contributed gratuitously\r\nby the Electric Telegraph Company; the work being\r\ndone under the direction of their resident agent at Newcastle,\r\nMr. Mathews.",
