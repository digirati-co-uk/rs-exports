I will now point out the only cause from which,\r\nin my judgement, any perceptible error can arise.\r\nIt was my intention that the temperature of the\r\nupper station should be brought, as near as could\r\npractically be done, to that of the lower station. In\r\nthe first week however Mr. Deakin was seized with\r\na sudden and severe illness, and the transmission of\r\nthe detailed observations to me was in consequence delayed.\r\nAn inequality of temperature which began accidentally was thus allowed to\r\nexist too long to admit of correction.
