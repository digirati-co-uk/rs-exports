It will be better\r\ntherefore in the first instance to give no attention to the\r\nlocal irregularities near the upper station: to assume\r\nthat the surface there is spherical: to find with this\r\nassumption how we can satisfy the three conditions: and\r\nafterwards to make allowance for the effect of the irregularities\r\nnear the upper station.",
