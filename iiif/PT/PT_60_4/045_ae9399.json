The positions of these \r\npoints, as deduced from a combination of these equations \r\nwith my own are given at \"D\", \"W\" and \"Y\". The difference \r\nof these positions from those of \"d\" \"w\" and \"y\" shows the \r\namount of discrepancy between observation and theory. \r\n\r\nIt will be observed that D is situated near V (vermillion), \r\nbut that a line from D to W cuts UV at C near to V. D is therefore \r\na red colour, not scarlet, but further from yellow \r\nIt may be called crimson, and may be <u>imitated<\\u>  by a mixture \r\nof 86 vermillion and 14 ultramarine This compound colour \r\nwill be of the same <u>hue<\\u> as D but since <s>D<\\s> c lies between \r\nD and W, c must be regarded as D diluted with a certain \r\namount of white, and therefore D must be imagined to be \r\nlike c in hue, but without the intermixture of white \r\nwhich is unavoidable in actual pigments and which \r\nreduces the purity of the tint. \r\n\r\nLines drawn from D through \"W\" and \"Y\", <s>pass through<\\s> \r\nthe colourblind positions of white & yellow pass through \r\nW & Y, their positions in ordinary vision. The reason \r\nwhy they do not coincide with W & Y is that the white and \r\nyellow papers are much brighter than the colours corresponding \r\nto the points W & Y of the triangle V,U,G <s>since<\\s> and therefore \r\nlines from D, which represent them in intensity as well \r\nas <s>[text?]<\\s> in quality, must be longer than DW & DY in <s>that<\\s> the \r\nproportion of their brightness",
