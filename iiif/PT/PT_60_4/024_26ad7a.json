It will be \r\nseen, however, that the number in the second column is always \r\nless, and that in the third always greater, than that in the fourth; \r\nshowing that the errors are not independent of each other, but \r\nthat positive errors in any colour coincide more often with \r\npositive than with negative errors in another colour. \r\nNow the <u>hue<\\u> of the resultant depends on the <u>ratios<\\u> of the \r\ncomponents while its <u>brightness<\\u> depends on their sum. \r\n",
