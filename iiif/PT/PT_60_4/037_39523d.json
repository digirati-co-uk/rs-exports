The green at E \r\nappears a good yellow, and the blue at [twothirds] from F towards G \r\nappears a good blue. I have therefore taken these as \r\nstandard colours for <s>referring d<\\s> reducing dichromic observations. \r\nThe three standard colours will be referred to as (104), (88) & (68) \r\nthese being the positions of the red, green and blue on the scale of \r\nthe new instrument. \r\nMr James Simpson, formerly student of Natural Philosophy \r\nin my class, has furnished me with <s>the<\\s> 33 observations taken \r\nin good sunlight. Ten of these were between the two standard \r\ncolours and give the following result \r\n33.7(88) + 33.1(68) = W (1) \r\nThe mean errors of these observations were as follows \r\n[text?] of (88) = 2.5 of (68) = 2.3 of (88)+(68) = 4.8 of (88)-(68) = 1.3. \r\nThe fact, that the mean error of the sum was so much greater than \r\n[the] mean error of the difference, indicates that in this case, as in \r\n[a]ll others that I have examined, observations of equality of tint \r\ncan be depended on much more than observations of equality \r\n[o]f illumination or brightness. \r\nFrom 6 observations of my own, made at the same time, I have \r\ndeduced the \"trichromic\" equation \r\n22.6(104) + 26(88) + 37.4(68) = W (2) \r\nIf we suppose that the light which reached the organ of vision was the ",
