The colour (20), and those beyond (64), are not \r\nfar from the line joining (24) & (68). The spectrum, therefore, \r\n<s>he<\\s> as exhibited in Newtons diagram, forms two sides of a triangle \r\nwith doubtful fragments of the third side. Now if three colours \r\nin Newton's diagram lie in a straight line the middle one is a \r\ncompound of the two others. Hence all the colours of the \r\nspectrum may be compounded of those which lie at the angles \r\nof this triangle which correspond to the following colours.\r\nTable VII\r\nScale Wave-length Index in water Wave-length in water \r\nR Scarlet 2328 1.332 1.747 \r\nG Green 46[threequarters] 1914 1.334 1.435 \r\nB Blue 64[half] 1717 1.339 1.282 \r\n\r\nAll the other colours of the spectrum may be produced by \r\ncombinations of these, and since all natural colours are \r\ncompounded of the colours of the spectrum, they may be compounded \r\nof these three primary colours I have strong reason to believe \r\nthat these are the three primary colours corresponding to three \r\nmodes of sensation in the organ of vision, on which the whole \r\nsystem of colour, as seen by the normal eye, depends. \r\n<s>To exhibit this more clearly let us transform the last set of equations \r\nin terms of R G and B three new standard colours \r\nR=(1.5)(24)+(0.125)(44)+0.007(68) \r\nG=-(0.023)(24)+ (44) + 0.013(68) \r\nB=(0.003)(24) + (0.0075)(44) +(68)<\\s>",
