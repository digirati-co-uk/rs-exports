From E to one third beyond \r\n[text?] towards G the colour is mixed, varying from \"yellow\" to \"blue\" and becoming \r\nneutral or \"white\" at a point near F In this part of the spectrum \r\n[text?] total intensity, as given by the dotted line, is decidedly less than  \r\n[text?] either side of it, and near the line F, the retina close to the \r\n[\"y]ellow spot\" is less sensible to light than the parts further from \r\n[the] axis of the eye. This peculiarity of the light near F is even more \r\nmarked in the colour blind than in the ordinary eye. Beyond F the \r\n['b]lue' element comes to a maximum between F & G, and then diminishes towards \r\nthe spectrum from this maximum to the end being pure \"blue\".  ",
