Let [lambda]1, [lambda]2 be the wave=lengths of these fixed lines as \r\ndetermined by Fraunhofer, then \r\n[equations not transcribed]\r\nHaving thus found N & R, we may find the wave=length corresponding \r\nto the dark band n from the formula - \r\n[lambda]=R/N+n (10) \r\nIn my experiments the line D corresponded with the seventh \r\ndark band, and F <s>with<\\s> was between the 15th and 16th so that n2=15.7 \r\nHere then for D, n1=7 [lambda]1=2175 \r\nn2=15.7 [lambda]2=1794 in Fraunhofers measure (11) ",
