The sensation which I have in addition \r\nto those of the dichromic eye is therefore similar to the full red (104), \r\nbut different from it, in that the red (104) has 7.7 of green (88), in it \r\nwhich must be removed, and 4.3 of blue (68) substituted. This \r\nagrees pretty well with the colour which Mr. Pole describes \r\nas neutral to him, though crimson to others. It must be remembered, \r\nhowever, that different persons of ordinary vision require different proportions \r\nof the standard colours, probably owing to differences in the absorptive \r\npowers of the media of the eye. and that the above equation (2) \r\nif observed by K, would have been \r\n23(104) + 32(88) + 31(68) = W (4) \r\nand the value of D, as deduced from these observers, would have been \r\n23(104) - 1.7(88) - 1.1(68) = D (5) \r\nin which the defective sensation is much nearer to the red of the spectrum. \r\nIt is probably a colour to which the extreme red of the spectrum tends, \r\nand which differs from the extreme red only in not containing that small \r\nproportion of \" yellow\" light which renders it visible to the colourblind. \r\nFrom other observations by Mr Simpson the following results \r\nhave been deduced \r\nTable a \r\n(88) (68) \r\n(99.2+) = 33.7 1.9 \r\n31.3 (96) = 33.7 2.1 \r\n28 (92) = 33.7 1.4 \r\n33.7 (88) = 33.7 0 \r\n54.7 (84) = 33.7 6.1 \r\n71 (82) = 33.7 15.1 \r\n99 (80) = 33.7 33.1 \r\n100 (96) = 1081  7 \r\n100 (92) = 120 5 \r\n100 (88) = 100 0 \r\n100 (84) = 61 11 \r\n100 (82) = 47 21 \r\n100 (80) = 34 33 \r\n \r\n100(80)= 34 33 ",
