The Gneiss immediately\r\nto the Eastward of the last mentioned line dips about\r\nE15S at angles rarely exceeding 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0: this\r\ndip gradually encreases as we proceed Eastward\r\ntill it reaches the perpendicular on the line just\r\ntraced through the middle of Ross-shire, thus\r\nforming half an arch only 20 miles wide at its\r\nsouthern & nearly 30 miles wide at its\r\nnorthern extremity of which the western half is entirely wanting. But on the western side\r\nof the line between Loch Eribol & <s>the point of Slate<\\s> Loch Maree head\r\nall the Gneiss of the main land & that of the\r\nisland of Lewis strikes towards the North West:\r\nthus the axes of elevation of the two districts <s>are<\\s> run\r\nnearly at right angles to one another. <s>In<\\s> Mr.\r\nCunningham who has drawn attention to the line\r\ncommencing at Loch Eribol as far as it runs\r\nthrough Sutherland, regarded the Gneiss to the\r\nEast of that line as of a more recent formation\r\nthan that to the Westward of it, stating that\r\nthe Eastern Gneiss often overlies the stratified\r\nQuartz-Rock & Limestone, which never occurs\r\nto the Westward of the line in question*. \r\n*Geognostical Account of Sutherland pp. 96 to 100.",
