W. Fox since repeated by Mr. Hunt\r\nupon the changes produced by long-continued Voltaic\r\nElectricity upon masses of clay, bricks &c.*. The\r\nresults produced have a sufficient analogy <s>to the<\\s>\r\nboth to lamination & foliation to rouse our attention\r\nto the subject without coming near enough\r\nto the great features described in this paper to allow\r\nus to regard them as a solution of the problem.\r\nIn the mass of clay operated on by Mr. Hunt\r\n(fig. 12, p. 451) one side has assumed a laminated\r\n& the other a foliated structure, the latter being\r\n<>more<\\s> curved & more contorted than the former, as\r\nis usually the case in similar structures in the earth;\r\nbut we do not see the regularity which is so striking\r\nin laminated rocks, & the two structures instead\r\nof harmonizing as in nature, appear in a sort\r\nof opposition being produced on opposite sides\r\nof the mass in an unconformable position.\r\nThe changes produced in the brick <s>p.455<\\s>\r\n(51) & Plaster of Paris (49), p. 4<s>8<\\s>53 are more analogous\r\nto what may sometimes be seen in rocks \r\n* Memoirs of the Geological Survey, vol. 1. p. 451 & 453.",
