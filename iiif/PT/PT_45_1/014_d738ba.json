In Strath Earn the boundary\r\nof the slate trends somewhat Southward of it's previous\r\ncourse ; but this has not altered the direction of the\r\nof the perpendicular plane, which runs N60E through the\r\nMica Schist 1\u00bd mile south of St. Fillan\u2019s: <s>thus thus\r\nformation of the Mica Schist thus continues vertical\r\nalong nearly the same plane as the cleavage of the Slates<\\s>\r\nThe line <s>appears to<\\s> follows <s>exactly<\\s> nearly the same direction\r\nthrough Perthshire without further disturbance,\r\nrunning N45E through the Clay Slate on the north\r\nside of Dunkeld; through Mica Schist at the\r\nBrig-o-Cally with a strike of N50E beyond\r\nwhich spot I did not follow it. Thus along the\r\nHighland border the <s>vertical<\\s> foliation of the Mica\r\nSchist & the cleavage of the Slate are both vertical\r\nalong lines so closely corresponding, that they may\r\nare laid down on the geological maps of Sutherland and Banffshire by the late Mr:\r\nCunningham published in the 46th & 57th numbers of the Journal\r\nof the Highland Society for September 1839 & June 1842: these have been of great service to me.",
