The result of an <s>observation<\\s> examination\r\nof that district, fully bears out Mr. Darwin\u2019s\r\nopinion: where the two Formations come together the <s>two<\\s> Cleavage\r\n& Foliation are not only conformable at the\r\njunction, but combine to<s>gether<\\s> form an arch\r\nin common. I have selected four sections to\r\nillustrate this conformity under different circum-\r\nstances: at Dunkeld, and on the east side of Loch\r\nLomond, fig. 1 & 3, an arch formed principally of the\r\nfoliation of the Mica Schist, is completed by\r\nthe addition of the cleavage of part of the Slate\r\non its southern flank. In Strath Earn & the\r\nlower part of Glen Shee, Fig 4 & 5, the foliation\r\nof the Mica Schist besides forming a complete\r\narch, supplies part of <s>another<\\s> the imperfect portion\r\nof another arch to the south, in which it is\r\ncombined conformably with the cleavage planes\r\nof the Slates: a similar conformity between the foliation & cleavage is\r\nfound throughout but the stratification of the Slate, indicated\r\nin the sections by the dotted lines, is unconformable\r\nto the foliation of the Mica Schist<s>& may be [text?]<\\s>  and is of no\r\naccount in the question under consideration.\r\n* Not to encumber this paper with details foreign to its\r\nprincipal object I reserve an account of the stratified rocks of\r\nthe Highland border for a communication to the Geological Society.",
