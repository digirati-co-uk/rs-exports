As the object\r\nof the sections Fig. 1.3. 4 & 5 is to show the direction\r\nof the dip of the foliation & cleavage, conti-\r\nnuous lines have been used to represent them\r\nwhile the dotted lines mark the stratification. The contortions of the foliation are indicated con-\r\nventionally as is explained at p.  since it would\r\nnot be possible to represent their real complica-\r\ntion on so small a scale. In Fig. 2 the upper line is an ideal\r\ncompletion of the curves indicated by the dips\r\nof the foliation & cleavage seen in Fig. 1. and\r\nthe lower line is a rough sketch of the outline of\r\nthe country: but it is not intended to be inferred\r\nthat the rocks ever reached up to the upper line\r\nIn all the sections the scale of height conside-\r\nrably exceeds that of length, but the angles of\r\ndip are preserved as nearly as the observations\r\ntaken on a large scale over broad tracts of country\r\nadmit of.
