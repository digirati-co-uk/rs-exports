In some places\r\nthe correspondence between the central axis of the folia-\r\ntion & the watershed of the district will be an\r\nassistance, but in many cases the axis of the\r\narch of foliation will be most easily ascertained\r\nby dividing the distance between the two vertical\r\nboundaries. For these reasons, in describing the geo-\r\ngraphical arrangement of the Foliation & Cleavage\r\nthrough the Highlands I shall point out in most\r\ndetail the lines on which their planes are perpendicular.\r\nOn the map which accompanies this paper\r\n<s>these lines of<\\s> the direction of the vertical planes <s>are marked are laid down<\\s>\r\n<s>they are<\\s> is marked by <s>a<\\s>  double\r\nlines as far as I observed them or find them recorded; <s>which<\\s> these are continued in <s>a<\\s> double <s>dotted<\\s> lines of dots to\r\nshow the supposed continuation of the observed\r\nportions: the central axes are indicated by a\r\nsingle thick line continued by dots in the same manner ",
