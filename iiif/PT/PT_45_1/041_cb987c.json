The whole of the\r\nfoliated rocks are painted of one yellow color, which\r\nthus includes Gneiss, Mica Schist, Chlorite Schist\r\nHornblende Schist & the gneissose Quartz rock.\r\nThe stratified Slates are colored purple. The brown\r\ncolor includes the Old Red Sandstone, the stratified\r\nQuartz Rock & the Limestones associated with\r\nthem. The more modern formations which cover\r\na very small space in the Highlands are omitted.\r\nGranite, Syenite & the older Porphyries are colored\r\npink, & the more modern Trap-Rocks red.
