The \r\nmost important of these are connected with the\r\noutbursts of Granite, Porphyry & similar rocks\r\nfar more numerous than are represented on any of our maps\r\nwhich have broken through the Gneiss & Schists\r\n& deranged the regularity of their foliation. <s>Often<\\s> Many\r\ndistricts also may have been disturbed by agents which\r\nhave not shown themselves on the surface; of\r\nthese, the neighbourhood of Loch Lomond is <s>the most<\\s> a\r\nremarkable instance. <s>I observed.<\\s> But as <s>I regard<\\s>\r\nthe Gneiss <s>as<\\s> appears to be the most ancient of the formations\r\nnow visible in Scotland, so also <s>I consider<\\s> the\r\nphysical features connected with the foliation\r\nof the Gneiss <s>as<\\s> must be regarded as the earliest of which we\r\ncan take cognizance, & we must refer to later periods\r\nthose which appear to be independent of that\r\nphenomenon.
