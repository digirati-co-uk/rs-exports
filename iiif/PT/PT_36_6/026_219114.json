The structure of the stomach in the <u>Medusae<\\u> is in general \r\nidentical with that of the same organ in the rest of the \r\nseries - The <u>Rhizostomidae<\\u> offer an apparent difficulty \r\nbut it appears to me that the marginal folds in these \r\nanswer to the stomacal membrane of the <u>monostome<\\u> Medusae \r\nthe apertures to the inner orifice of their stomach - and \r\nthe common canal to their \"common cavity\" - Just as \r\nin a polygastric <u>Diphyes<\\u> the common tube answers to the \r\nchamber into which the stomach of a monogastric Diphyes \r\nopens - And in Cephea Wagneri (Will) these resemblances \r\nare still more striking - He says that each cotyledon \"has at its \r\napex a small round opening, the mouth, which leads to an ovate \r\ncavity occupying the whole interior of the cotyledon - I consider this as \r\nthe proper digestive or stomacal cavity and believe that the cotyledons \r\nhave the same relation to the vessels as the so called suckers (Saugrohren) \r\nof the Diphydae to the common tube (Saftrohren)\". * \r\n[paragraph].60. The Disc of a <u>Medusa<\\u> is represented by the Natatorial organ \r\namong the Diphydae & Physophoridae - take for instance the \r\ndisc of <u>Oceania<\\u> or <u>Cytaeis<\\u> - It is here a more or less bell shaped \r\n* Horae Tergutinae. p. 60. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n",
