(Fig.30) \r\n[paragraph].32. the marginal tentacles of <u>Thaumantias<\\u> are very similar \r\n(Fig 3) to the buccal tentacles of <u>Mesonema<\\u> - they consist of an outer \r\nmembrane in which numbers of thread cells are imbedded and \r\nan inner axis composed of clear cells arranged end to end - they \r\nhave a peculiarity which has ben already pointed out by \r\nProf. Ed. Forbes in being placed above the marginal <s>tentacle<\\s> \r\nvesicles instead of being alternate with them as in the nearly \r\nallied genus <u>Geryonia<\\u>, and from this fact and <s<their<\\s> from \r\ntheir totally different structure I believe that they have \r\na totally different origin - In <u>Geryonia<\\u> the tentacles belong \r\nto the second class - are processes of the circular canal; in \r\n<u>Thaumantias<\\u> they are simple processes of the outer foundation \r\nmembrane - i.e. of the substance of the disc - Perhaps his difference \r\nin structure among the tentacles may turn out to be a good \r\nmeans of generic distinction among other members of the class. \r\n[paragraph]. 33. As to the second class of tentacles. Such are the marginal \r\ntentacles of <u>Mesonema<\\u> - of <u>Geryonia<\\u> (Will) of <u>Oceania<\\u>, & \r\nof <u>Medusa Aurita<\\u> (Ehrenberg); the tentacles of the under \r\nsurface of <u>Phacellophora<\\u> and the interbrachial tentacles of <u>Cephea<\\u> \r\n10\r\n",
