In the specimens of <u>Mesonema\\u> I obtained there were \r\nnot more than eight <s>of<\\s> tentacles placed at equal distances \r\nround the disc which had attained their full development \r\nthe interval between every two was filled up by a series of bud like \r\nrudimentary tentacles and marginal corpuscles alternate \r\nwith them - Each tentacle in its bud like rudimentary \r\nform is simply a caecal process of the circular canal and \r\nhas therefore like it, a double wall and an internal cavity \r\nusually filled with granules in rapid motion produced by \r\nthe ciliae of the inner wall - the outer wall contains large \r\nthread cells - The structure of the adult tentacle is essentially \r\nthe same but in the course of its growth it has become divided \r\ninto a lower filamentous portion and an upper dilated one \r\nby which it communicated with the circular canal (Fig. 8) \r\nThe marginal tentacles of <u>Oceania<\\u> <s>have precisely the<\\s> resemble \r\nthese in all points - they are double walled - communicate \r\nfreely with the circular canal and contain an immense \r\nnumber of minute thread cells in their outer wall (Fig. 15) \r\n[paragraph]. 35. In <u>Phacellophora<\\u> there is no distinct marginal circular canal \r\nbut the <s>canals<\\s> sixteen radiating canals are very wide and sacci-\r\nform & communicate only by anastomosing  marginal branches \r\nEight of the canals are narrower and run to the marginal \r\ncorpuscles - The alternate eight are very much wider and \r\ntheir outer, under, surface is beset with a curved series of long \r\ntentacles - (Fig.18) Now the lower wall of the canals is composed \r\nof the two \"foundation membranes\" and the tentacles are simply \r\nprolongations of these membranes They are therefore double walled \r\nand contain a cavity continuous with that of the canal \r\n11\r\n",
