The large interbrachial tentacles of <u>Cephea<\\u> are processes \r\nof the branched arms. For the greater part of their length they \r\nhave the same structure as the arms i.e. consist of a dense thick \r\ntransparent outer substance and an inner membranous wall \r\ninclosing a tubular canal - but at the extremity they are \r\nthickened - and the outer wall is raised into a number of \r\nsmall pyriform processes 1/160<sup>th<\\sup> of an inch in diameter and thickly \r\ncovered with minute spherical thread cells 1/5000 in. in diameter \r\nAt the same time the central canal becomes branched out \r\ninto a kind of plexus which occupies the interior of the enlarged \r\nend of the tentacle (fig. 37) These tentacles are 2 inches or more \r\nin length and 1/13<sup>th<\\sup> in. in thickness but other smaller \r\ntentacles 3/4<sup>s<\\sup> of an inch in length by 1/20<sup>th<\\sup> in. in diameter depended \r\nfrom the arched concavity of the brachiferous plate - Their general \r\nstructure much resembled that of the foregoing except that \r\nthe central canal terminated in a blind simple extremity \r\nand that the pyriform bodies extended rather further \r\nup the stem - \r\nBeside these there was a third small kind of tentacles \r\nwhich appeared as small blue points among the stomachs \r\nThese were clavate bodies placed without any regular \r\norder in the [text?] between the stomachs and containing \r\n12\r\n",
