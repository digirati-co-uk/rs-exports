The structure of the inner membrane of the disc and its canals resembles \r\nthat of the corresponding tissue in the stomach &c - but in the ultimate \r\nramifications of the canals it becomes more delicate - \r\nIn these points there exists a difference the Monostome \r\n& Rhizostome medusae \r\n[paragraph] 18. Three divisions vary somewhat in the arrangement of \r\nthe cavities and canals of the disc \r\nIn the <u>Cryptocarpae<\\u> the common cavity may be either small \r\n(Thaumantias) or large (Oceania) from it there proceeds a number \r\nof straight unbranching canals which open into a circular \r\ncanal running round the margin of the disc \r\nIn the <u>Phanerocarpae<\\u> the general arrangement is similar, but the \r\ncanals frequently branch (Medusa aurita, Phacellophora) and \r\nanastomose in a reticulate manner \r\nIn many of the monostome Medusae the centre of the under \r\nsurface of the disc projects into the \"common cavity\" as a rounded \r\nbass[?] (f 11.a) And according to its form and size will it seem to \r\ndivide the former more or less into secondary cavities - This \r\nappears to me to be the origin of the multiple stomachs of \r\nthe Medusa Aurita, as described by Ehenberg - \r\n[paragraph] 19 In the Rhizostomidae, - the canals of the branched processes \r\nunite and open by four (Rhizostoma, Cephea) or eight \r\n(Cassiopea?) distinct trunks into a wide variously shaped cavity \r\nfrom where anastomosing canals are given off to all parts of \r\nthe disc (fig. 26. 26a) The circular vessel exists but is not particularly \r\nobvious in consequence of anastomosing branches being given \r\noff beyond it - \r\n",
