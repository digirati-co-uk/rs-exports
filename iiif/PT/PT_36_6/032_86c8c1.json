The ovarium of the <u>Plumularia<\\u> above mentioned ([paragraph].65.) \r\ncommences as a dilatation of the apex of its pedicel which again \r\nis a process of the common stem - It then becomes lenticular \r\nwith a horny outer wall - glassy and transparent externally but \r\ninternally coloured by pigment masses - Internally it has \r\nan oval cavity communicating with that of the stem and \r\nlined by a distinct membrane (fig.45) Between the two membranes \r\nis a thick layer of ova, more or less oval in shape & about \r\n1/350<sup>th<\\sup> in diameter with a germinal spot about 1/2400<sup>th<\\sup> in diam. \r\nseated in the middle of a clear space about twice that size \r\nwhich doubtless represents the germinal vesicle\r\n[paragraph].69 The account given by Lowen of the generative organs of \r\n<u>Campanularia<\\sup> differs considerably from the foregoing.
