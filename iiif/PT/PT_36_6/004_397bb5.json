If one of the ultimate ramuscules be examined it will be found to consist \r\nof a thick transparent substance - similar in constitution to that of \r\nthe mass of the disc - through which there runs nearer one edge \r\nthan the other a canal with a distinct membranous wall ciliated \r\ninternally - Now this \"common canal\" a series of parallel diverticula \r\nare given off at regular intervals and run to the edge of the branch \r\nwhere they terminate by rounded, oblique openings - It is not \r\nalways easy to see these apertures but I have repeatedly satisfied \r\nmyself of their presence by passing a needle or other delicate body \r\ninto them (Fig. 28. 29.) \r\n[paragraph].12. The difficulty in seeing the openings arises in great measure \r\nfrom the presence of a membrane which surrounds and overlaps them \r\nand being very irritable contracts over them on being touched \r\nThe membrane consists of two processes one from each side of the \r\nperforated edge of the branch (Fig. 28) In Rhizostoma these two processes \r\ngenerally remain distinct - so that their bases form a common \r\nchannel into which all the apertures open - But in <u>Cephea<\\u> \r\nthey are frequently united in front of and behind each aperture \r\nso as to form a distinct Polype-like cell (Figs. 35. 36). \r\n[paragraph] 13. Each membranous process is composed of two membranes - the \r\nouter of these is continuous with and passes into the thick transparent \r\nouter substance above mentioned ([paragraph] 11.) the other is less transparent, \r\nmore richly ciliated, and continuous with the lining membrane \r\nof the canals through the apertures - the two membranes are \r\ncontinuous at the free edge of the fold and are here produced \r\ninto numerous tentacula - the latter are beset with \r\n",
