The structure of the generative organs in <u>Phacellophora<\\u> is \r\nas follows : - The voluminous folded and plaited \r\nstomacal membrane is attached by four thick pillars to \r\nthe under surface of the disc - The edges of the pillars are \r\nconnected by a thin membrane - which is concave externally \r\nso as to form a sort of shallow depression or generative cavity \r\nbut the central and some of the marginal parts of this \r\nmembrane are produced into long plaited processes which \r\nhang far out of the cavity (fig. 18) Each process is a sort of \r\nsac communicating freely at its attached extremity with \r\nthe cavity of the stomach - air &c passing readily from the one \r\nto the other - It is in fact a sort of eversion of the walls of the \r\n15\r\n",
