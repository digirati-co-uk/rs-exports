June 16 1859 J.B.\r\nread same day.\r\nIn treating a great problem of approximation,\r\nsuch as that presented to us by the investigation \r\nof the Moon\u2019s motion, experience shows that \r\nnothing is more easy than to neglect, on account \r\nof their apparent insignificance, considerations \r\nwhich ultimately prove to be of the greatest \r\nimportance. One instance of this occurs with reference \r\nto the secular acceleration, & the diminution of the \r\neccentricity of the Earth\u2019s orbit, on which it depends,\r\nhad been made known by observation, as separate \r\nfacts, yet many of the first Geometers altogether \r\nfailed to trace any connexion between them, and it \r\nwas not till he had made repeated attempts to \r\nexplain the phenomenon by other means, that \r\nLaplace himself succeeded in referring it to its \r\ntrue cause.",
