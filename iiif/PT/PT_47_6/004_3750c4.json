I will take the <u>variation<\\u>, the most \r\ndirect effect of the disturbing force.\r\nIn the ordinary Theory,  the orbit of the Moon as \r\naffected by this Inequality only, would be symmetrical \r\nwith respect to the line of conjunction with the Sun,\r\nand the areal velocity generated while the moon was \r\nmoving from quadrature to syzygy, would be exactly \r\ndestroyed while it was moving from syzygy to \r\nquadrature, so that no permanent alteration \r\nwould be produced.\r\nIn reality, however, the magnitude of the disturbing \r\nforce by which this inequality is caused, depends in \r\nsome degree on the eccentricity of the Earth\u2019s orbit,\r\n& as this is continually diminishing, the disturbing \r\nforces at equal intervals before & after conjunction \r\nwill not be exactly equal. Hence the orbit is no \r\nlonger symmetrically situated with respect to the line ",
