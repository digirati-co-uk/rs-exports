And, if to eyes \r\nso drawn an upward cast of features be substituted \r\nfor the former, the eyes seem immediately to look \r\nabove us.\r\nWhen the turn of a pair of eyes partakes of both \r\ninclinations, so as to be in a direction laterally \r\nupwards, the alteration produced by changing the \r\nposition of the face affords the most striking \r\nexemplification of the force of this principle, as \r\nmay be seen in Plate III & its companion.\r\nBut the effect thus producible is by no means \r\nlimitted to the mere extent of deviation, as a total \r\ndifference of character may be given to the same ",
