White. I have \r\nto report on it as follows.\r\nThe paper is in fact a Magnetic Survey of the \r\ncoasts of Britain, as regards Magnetic Declination \r\nonly. In this limited sense, the paper is very \r\ncomplete, and, as accompanied with its map,\r\nis worthy to be accepted hereafter as a sufficiently \r\naccurate representation of the general state of Magnetic \r\nDeclination about Britain in the year 1872. I will \r\nallude to the following specific points.\r\n1. The Magnetic Instrument employed is the Admiralty \r\nCompass. This instrument is less sensitive than a suspended \r\nneedle, for minute variations, but it is also less liable to \r\nconstant error <s>[text?]<\\s> lasting for a sensible time. I \r\nthink that it was the best instrument for the purpose.\r\n2. On the Instruments used for determining the Astronomical \r\nProfessor Stokes \r\nSecretary of the Royal Society.",
