The author also describes \r\nat some length the method he employed in \r\ninjecting the vessels of the lungs. The chief \r\nnovelty of his plan is the simultaneous injection \r\nof two sets of vessels by an equal amount of \r\npressure, by means of an apparatus which he \r\nhas contrived for the purpose.\r\nThe author here and there refers to some \r\npoints in the physiology of the lungs, and his \r\nviews of the subject are certainly peculiar \r\nones. For examples, in speaking of \u201cthe tissue \r\nof the pleura itself\u201d he says \u201cthis structure \u2018must \r\n\u2018therefore be a product of secretion of the cellular \r\ntissue immediately beneath it\u201d P.5.\r\nwhile he admits that the mucous membrane of \r\nthe bronchial tubes is nourished from the bronchial \r\nvessels he believes the bronchial mucus to be \r\nfurnished by the pulmonary vessels.
