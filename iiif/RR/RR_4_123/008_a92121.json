Its defects \r\nappear to me to be due, not to a deficiency \r\nof work, but rather to the fact that the \r\nenquiry is one which the author was not \r\nthoroughly qualified, by his previous labours,\r\nto undertake.\r\nI must in conclusion express my opinion \r\nthat it is not fitted for a place in the \r\nPhilosophical Transactions, nor do I believe \r\nthat its publication in its present form \r\nwould prove to be of advantage to the best \r\ninterests of its author.\r\nWm S. Savory \r\nMarch. 1861.\r\n",
