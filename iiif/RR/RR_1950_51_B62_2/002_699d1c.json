The author might refer to this point.\r\nThe treatment would be easier to follow were the assumptions made \r\nclear. It appears to be assumed throughout, for example (1) that \r\nmorphogens cannot diffuse out of the organism, which they certainly \r\ndo, e.g. in fungal cultures, and (2) that diffusion through a cell \r\nwall is very much slower than through the interior of a cell. Such \r\nassumptions should, I think, be stated.\r\nAgain, the genetical theory of p.3 is rather insecure. In many \r\nembryos (e.g. embryo Salmonidae <u>fide<\\u> Svardson) the chromosomes are \r\nmuch larger than in adult tissue, and in others (<u>fide<\\u> Pasteels and \r\nLison) the amount of desoxyribo-nucleic acid per cell is much greater.\r\nThere is at least a <u>prima facie<\\u> case that there may be a large number \r\nof examples of each type of gene in a given nucleus. As embryonic \r\ndevelopment is under consideration, this is important.\r\nAgain, on p.62 \u2018This is gastrulation\u2019 seems an overstatement. \r\nLocalized overgrowth might easily yield a pearshaped form, and the \r\nkinematics of gastrulation are, in fact, very complicated (cf. Vogt, \r\nDalcq, etc.)\r\nThe following is a probably incomplete list of errata:\r\np.6. l.26 \u20181\u2019 omitted.\r\np.9. l.17 \u2018equilib<u>t<\\u>ium\u2019\r\np.13.l. 2 \u2018mo<u>t<\\u>phogen\u2019; l.8. \u2018concentra<u>n<\\u>tion\u2019\r\np.15.l. 8 \u2018u<u>sal<\\u>ly\u2019\r\np.16.l.11 \u2018le<u>as<\\u>t\u2019; l.29. \u2018mirro<u>w<\\u>\u2019\r\np.38.l. 9 ?R(t) and t omitted.\r\np.47.l.25 \u2018i<u>a<\\u>\u2019\r\np.50.l.4 ?\u2019C\u2019 omitted \r\n? on p.30 l.1 = [half] and (8.3) to read ",
