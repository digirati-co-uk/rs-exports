In the case of \u201c<u>huitres de Marennes <\\u>\u201d  \r\nthe authors \r\nconfirm in detail the results obtained by Lankester in 1885,\r\nbut do not add anything of importance. They also confirm the \r\nold statements that some oysters are green, not from the presence \r\nof a colouring matter derived from <u>Navicula ostrocaria <\\u>, as is the \r\ncase in Marennes oysters, but from the presence of some other \r\npigment: and they confirm the statement often made, and lately \r\nsubstantiated by Thorpe, that the pigment in question contains copper.\r\nSo far, the paper does not seem to me to contain any \r\nstatements of importance.
