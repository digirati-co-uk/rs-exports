Many \r\nparagraphs in the two are literally identical, and all the \r\nanalytical tables, given in the present paper, are printed in \r\nfull in the B.A. Report.\r\n2.- <u>The opening section of the chapter on Microchemistry <\\u> (pp.42.44)\r\nis a <u>verbatim <\\u> copy of the section <u>Investigation of the Pigment <\\u>\u201d\r\nin B.A. Reports 1897 pp. 365 and 366.\r\n3.- <u>The presence of copper especially in the leucocytes <\\u> has been \r\nasserted already by the authors in Roy. Soc. proc. LXII. p. 30, and \r\nB. A. Reports 1897 p. 365, and no additional statements of \r\nimportance are made in the present paper.\r\n4.- Most of the statements on the growth of oysters in solutions \r\nof iron and copper salts (pp. 46-50) have been summarised \r\nin the B. A. Reports. The new statement,- that oysters grown \r\nfor a long time in very dilute solutions of copper do take up that \r\nmetal,- is not accompanied by detailed statements of \r\nanalytical results. The quantities of copper dealt with are \r\nso minute that analytical details should in my opinion \r\nbe given.\r\n5.- <u>Chapter XI On the Connection between Oysters and Infection <\\u> pp. 50-56\r\nis an almost literal copy of the paper by the authors, published \r\nin B. A. Reports 1895, pp. 723-72. The only substantial \r\nalteration is the prefix of an unimportant introductory paragraph.\r\n6.- <u>Chapter XIII, On the Bacteriology of the Oyster and other \r\nShellfish <\\u>, is in large part <s>[text?]<\\s> copied, with only a few verbal \r\nalterations of slight importance, from B. A. Reports 1896\r\npp. 663-665 and <s>666<\\s> 667-668. The substance of pp. 60-70",
