There is as I have noticed elsewhere \r\nsome apparent divergence of result as to the \r\nexistence of a back electromotive force in the arc,\r\nbetween this paper and Mr. Duddell\u2019s on the same subject \r\nMrs Ayrton is of opinion that great heat is \r\ndeveloped in a film of great resistance close to \r\nthe positive carbon, while Mr. Duddell detects an \r\nopposing potential difference. It is true that Mr.\r\nDuddell as I understand him distinguishes between an opposing <s>E.M.F.<\\s> difference of potential and \r\na \u201cback E.M.F.\u201d but I do not understand the distinction.\r\nProfessor A.
