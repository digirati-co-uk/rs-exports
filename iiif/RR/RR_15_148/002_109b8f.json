Ayrton \r\nOn \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc.\" \r\n1. Whether the paper should or should not be published in the \"Philosophical \r\nTransactions? On the whole, yes. \r\n2. Whether, in the former case, it should be published in full or in part only, the part \r\nso to be published being indicated: \r\nThe style is diffuse and I am convinced that the \r\nsubstantial facts might be stated, perhaps more \r\nclearly in appreciably shorter compass, but I cannot \r\nindicate parts that could be omitted from the paper \r\nas it stands. \r\n3. Whether any modifications are necessary or desirable, and, if so, of what nature: \r\n4. Which illustrations (if any) accompanying the paper should be reproduced\r\nAs the paper stands, the figures seem all to be required, though \r\nI hardly think all of them are intrinsecally necessary. (E.g., if the \r\npaper were recast, perhaps Fig. 11 might be dispensed with, and it \r\nmight not be needful to retain all of 14, 15, 16) \r\nGeneral Remarks. \r\nIn one or two places the reasoning seems to me faulty or at least doubtful. \r\nE.g., page 8: - \"The temperature of the film\" [of supposed carbon vapour] \"cannot \r\nrise, because there is no increase of pressure,<s>\"<\\s> ....\". This implies that the volatilisation \r\nof carbon in the arc takes place at a fixed temp<sup>e<\\sup> depending on atmospheric pressure, \r\nlike the boiling point of a liquid. But there is no fixed temp<sup>e<\\sup> of evaporation or \r\nvolatilisation: the process only goes on quicker the higher the temp<sup>e<\\sup>. On page 10 also \r\nvolatilisation of carbon is spoken of as taking place at a fixed temp<sup>e<\\sup>. - Page 12: \r\n\"the quantity of carbon evaporated per second would be proportional to the \r\narea <u>a<\\u> and also to the heat employed in evaporating it.\" If the doctrine ",
