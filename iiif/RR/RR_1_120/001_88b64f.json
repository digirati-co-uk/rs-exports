The equation obtained is the same as that which M.\r\nLiouville has obtained by forming the differential equation \r\nfor the external <s>d<\\s> surface depending on the attraction and \r\ncentrifugal force, comparing this with the differential equation \r\nof the surface of the ellipsoid, and eliminating the centrifugal \r\nforce from the two equations obtained by this comparison. I\r\nshould prefer Mr. Ivory\u2019s as a statement of the fundamental \r\ngeometrical condition (instead of first introducing the centrifugal \r\nforce and afterwards eliminating it), except for the reason that \r\n<s>one<\\s> another of the necessary conditions, namely the proportionality of the \r\nline in the principal section to the perpendicular upon the smallest \r\naxis, though it appears as a result of the investigation, cannot be \r\nmade a condition for the problem.\r\nThe third section merely contains the substitution of the expressions <s>for<\\s>, in definite \r\nintegrals, for the principal attractions of the ellipsoid.\r\nThe fourth section is employed on the case of spheroids of revolution.",
