I beg to state in the first \r\nplace that my only acquaintance with Mr. Jacobi\u2019s \r\ntheorem is from M. Liouville\u2019s investigations at the \r\ntermination of the 23d Cahier of the Journal de \r\nl\u2019Ecole Polytechnique. My report therefore must be \r\nunderstood as being, for the most part, a comparison \r\nof Mr. Ivory\u2019s paper with M. Liouville\u2019s  investigation.\r\nFor convenience I shall advert to the different sections of \r\nthe paper in their order.\r\nIn the first section, the  enunciation of the problem \r\nis given, in a form amounting to this: \u201cTo find the relation \r\nS. H. Christie Esqre \r\nSec. R. Society \r\nOr order \r\nMr Airy\u2019s Report \r\non Mr Ivory\u2019s Paper \r\n10th Febry 1838. Rec\u2019d 13 Febry ",
