But \r\nin the substitution made in p.9. there is \r\nan obscurity which I have not had leisure \r\nto make clear to myself - In converting \r\nv-v\u2019 into terms of t, it would seem \r\nthat mv and successive terms are \r\nused for v\u2019, as if the relation of periodic \r\ntimes were unaltered - Any error \r\nhere would (I imagine) produce error of \r\nthe order m3. The change in the relation \r\nof periodic times is recognized in p.15\r\nbut it seems to me doubtful if this is early enough.\r\nThe change which Mr Adams has made \r\nin the coefficient is one sixth of the whole,\r\nan exceedingly important alteration,\r\nin reference to ancient eclipses. In noting \r\nthis, it is also proper to note that the 2nd term \r\nof the expression (depending on the square \r\nof the disturbing force), is numerically equal ",
