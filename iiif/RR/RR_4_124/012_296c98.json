It is difficult \r\nto conceive that such a happy triple \r\nrupture first out of one set of capillaries,\r\nthen through the celular tissue, and lastly \r\ninto another set of capillaries, should \r\ntake place. Those who have made many \r\ninjections know that it is much easier to \r\nsend the injection from the pulmonary artery \r\nor vein into the air cells than into the corres=\r\n=ponding artery or vein.\r\n<s>The Editors of the Sydenham  Society edition \r\nof<\\s> Kolliker in advocating the existence of \r\nanastomosis between the bronchial & pulmonary \r\nsystems of vessels does well to call to mind the \r\n\u201cdilatation of the bronchial arteries & extension \r\nof the Zone of distribution, in cases where\r\nthe circulation through the pulmonary \r\narteries is interrupted, in which cases the \r\nbronchial arteries frequently wholly replace \r\nbranches of the pulmonary artery, and \r\nbecome respiratory vessels; conditions ",
