School of Mines, Jermyn St\r\nJuly 18. 1856\r\nMr Raineys observations upon pigs infested \r\nwith the Cysticercus cellulosae, appear to \r\nestablish the following facts \r\n1. The cellular Tissue contains bodies resembling \r\nthe vesicle of the Cysticercus in structure and \r\npresenting every gradation from the possession of a more or \r\nless completely developed head with nucleus \r\nand hooks to a condition in which these \r\nappendages are entirely absent. These bodies \r\nare contained in cysts and are not less than 1/10\u2019 to 1/20\u2019 in diameter.\r\n2. Within the sarcolemma of the primitive \r\nMuscular fascicules \u201cvermiform\u201d bodies are \r\ncontained some of which are not more than \r\n1/150th of an inch in length - They have \r\na distinct membranous wall which in the \r\nlarger forms is level with short perpendicular \r\nfibres and they contain masses of peculiar \r\nreniform corpuscles -\r\n3. Aggregations of reniform corpuscles of a similar \r\ncharacter but without any  investing membrane \r\nlie in the substance of the muscular fasciculi \r\n4. Irregular corpuscles are found loosely scattered \r\nin the substance of the muscles in conjunction \r\nwith the earliest forms of Cysticercus and in such\r\ncases only (p27)\r\n5. The capillaries are, in many cases where Cysticerci \r\nabound, altered and their ... more or less \r\nblocked up with minute molecules ",
