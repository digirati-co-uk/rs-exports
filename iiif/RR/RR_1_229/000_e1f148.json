Smyth's\r\npaper entitled \"Attempt to apply Instrumental\r\nMeasurements to the Zodiacal Light\", and have\r\nto report on it as follows.\r\n\r\nThe author, after graphically describing in \r\ngeneral terms one well marked instance of \r\nZodiacal Light which he had seen in the Cape \r\nColony, states that he had applied a rude \r\nequatoreal instrument to ascertain the Right \r\nAscension and Declination of the [open?] of the \r\nbeam, and gives the results of seven such determinations. \r\nI call attention specially to this \r\npart because it is the only part that is strictly \r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nA series of detailed remarks follow, explaining \r\nwhen and under what form the Zodiacal light\r\n\r\nS.
