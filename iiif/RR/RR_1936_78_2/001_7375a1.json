In order, however, to enable an author to consider suggested modifications, or to enable a communicator to consider the desirability of withdrawing a paper, it is frequently desirable to acquaint the communicator with the substance of a referee\u2019s criticisms. The referee is requested to enclose within square brackets any section of or phrase in his report, which he would wish to be withheld from the communicator in any correspondence of this kind\u2019.\r\nREFEREE\u2019S REPORT.\r\n\u2018To the Sectional Committee for <<botany>>\r\nPaper by <<W.H.
