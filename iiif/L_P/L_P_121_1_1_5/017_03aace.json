But I shall \r\nperhaps be better able to give an Account of these \r\nmatters when I come to the observations of future years.\r\n2. As I have taken notice in other places, so I \r\nfind in these Observations, a great Conformity between \r\nthe Winds, especially when strong for some time, and \r\nwhen they have been for some time in or near the \r\nsame Quarter.\r\n3. As for the Weather, no good judgment\r\ncould \r\nbe made of it in the Space of five\r\nWeeks, which is \r\nall the time in which the Observations tally: Only \r\nI take notice that Thunder was more frequent at \r\nLunden than Petersburgh during that time. \r\nAn ",
