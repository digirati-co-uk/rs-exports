By Wm. Derham F.R.S.\r\n\r\nHaving taken notice of the Observations in 1724, \r\nthat tally, I proceed to the whole Year's\r\nObserva-\r\ntions of Lunden.\r\nI begin with the Barometrical Ranges, which \r\nwill be best seen and compared by these two little \r\nTables: the first of which is, in part, the curious \r\nAuthor's, viz. the Mean Heights of the\r\nMercury symbol; \r\nto which I have added the highest and lowest Ranges \r\nin each Month. And because it will take\r\nup but lit-\r\ntle room, I have added the Author's Mean of his \r\nThermometrical Observations, although, I confess, \r\nI scarce understand the Divisions of his Thermometer.\r\nThe Highest & Lowest Ranges of the Barometer, and \r\nthe Mean of the Barometer & Thermometer at \r\nLunden in the year 1724.\r\nJan.
