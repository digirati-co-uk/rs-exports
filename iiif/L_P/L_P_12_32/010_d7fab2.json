The thickness corresponding \r\nto the extreme red , the line of yellow, bright green, bright blue,\r\nand extreme violet, I found to be inversely as the numbers \r\n27, 30, 35, 40, and 45, respectively. In consequence of Dr. Wollaston\u2019s\r\ncorrection of the description <s>division <\\s> of the prismatic spectrum, compared \r\nwith these observations, it becomes necessary to modify the \r\nsupposition that I advanced in the last Bakerian lecture respecting \r\nthe proportions of the sympathetic fibres of the retina; substituting \r\nred, green, and violet, for red, yellow and blue, and the numbers \r\n7, 6, and 5, for 8, 7, and 6.\r\nThe same prismatic analysis of the colours of \r\nthin plates, appears to furnish a satisfactory explanation of \r\nthe subdivision of the light of the lower part of a candle <s>observed \r\nalso by Dr. Wollaston <\\s>: for, in fact, the light transmitted through \r\nevery part of a thin plate, is divided in a similar manner \r\ninto distinct portions, increasing in number with the thickness \r\nof the plate until they become too minute to be visible. At the \r\n<s>Opposite <\\s> thickness corresponding to the ninth or tenth  <s>the tenth or eleventh <\\s> portion of red light, the number \r\nof portions of different colours is <s>six<\\s> five, and their proportions, as \r\nexhibited by refraction, are nearly the same as in the light of a \r\ncandle, the violet being the broadest.
