I have repeated \r\nhis experiment on the spectrum with perfect success, and \r\nI have made some attempts to procure comparative measures \r\nfrom thin plates; and I have found, that, as Sir Isaac Newton \r\nhas already observed, the blue<s>s<\\s> and violet<s>s<\\s> light is more \r\ndispersed by refraction than in proportion to the difference of ",
