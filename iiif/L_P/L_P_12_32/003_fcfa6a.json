I found \r\nthat six of the brightest red fringes, nearly at equal \r\ndistances, occupied the whole of that image. The \r\nbreadth of the aperture was 66/1000, and its distance \r\nfrom the hair, 8/10 of an inch; the diameter of the \r\nhair was less than 1/500 of an inch; as nearly as I \r\ncould ascertain, it was 1/600. Hence we have [11/1000 for \r\nthe deviation of the first red fringe at the distance 8/10,\r\nand as 8/10:11/1000::1/600:11/480000, or] 1/43636 for the difference \r\nof the routes of the <s>redlight <\\s> red light where it was most \r\nintense. The measure deduced from Newtons experiments \r\nis 1/39200. I thought this coincidence, with only an \r\nerror of one ninth of so minute a quantity, sufficiently perfect to warrant com-\r\npletely the explanation of the phenomenon, and even to \r\nrender a repetition of the experiment unnecessary: for there \r\nare several circumstances which make it difficult to calculate \r\nmuch more precisely what ought to be the result of the <s>admeasurement <\\s> measurement.\r\nWhen a number of fibres of the same kind, as,\r\nfor instance, a uniform lock of wool, are held near \r\nto the eye, we see an appearance of halos surrounding \r\na distant candle; but their brilliancy, and even their existence ",
