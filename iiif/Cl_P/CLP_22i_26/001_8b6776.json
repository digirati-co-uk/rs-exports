of the first kind are many valerians, the sea Lavenders, the Marvell of Peru, Agrimony, \r\nBurnet, Meadow-Rue, fumitory etc. the genuine umbells have pentapetalous flowers to each of which \r\nsucceed two naked seeds joined together, these are put under many subdivisions according to the vari \r\nous figures of their seeds and leaves; of this umbelliferous family are the Parsneps, the Fennells, \r\nthe Angelica\u2019s, the Cummin, Parsleys, Hemlocks, Smallage, Aniseed, Caraways, the Carrots, Coriander etc.\r\nall which are very nicely distinguished, and variously subdivided.\r\nThe 10th contains the stellate herbs, whose leaves like a radiated star embraces \r\nthe stalk;
