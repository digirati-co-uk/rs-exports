The forreign journalls having given accounts of this book have prevented \r\nthe mentioning of many particulars, but they only speaking in generall, and per saltum, neglecting \r\nthe divisions, subdivisions, and the method, I shall therefore only confine \r\nmyself to those particulars.\r\nThis first Tome contains 18 books, to which are premised the a Botanick Lexicon \r\nor interpretation of terms of art together with an account of most of the writers that have \r\nhandled the subject of plants. The first book treats of plants in generall, as of their roots, stalks,\r\nsap, juices, and their motions, and differences; of gems or buds, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, clavicles\r\nor climbers, prickles, their varieties, and vegetations; of sowing, propagating, cultivating, grafting,\r\nor inoculating; of the transmutations of plants, their statures or magnitudes, their ages or duration,\r\ntheir faculties, tasts, and uses, their places, and divisions; of collecting, drying, and preserving them,\r\ntheir chymical Analysis, and their \r\ndeseases.\r\nThe 2d Book begins with particulars, as the imperfect plants, such as seem to have \r\nno flower or seed; these are either submarine, as the Coralls, sponges, Alga\u2019s, wracks etc. Or Terres \r\ntriall, as the Mushroomes, and Barren mosses. Or subterraneous as the Truffles; some of the fungi and mosses \r\nhave visible seeds; these are all subdivided into subordinate genera, as the Mushroomes according \r\nto their lamellae, plates, brims, and caps, and as they are noxious or esculent, or grow upon \r\ntrees.\r\nThe 3d Book contains the capillary or acaulose herbs, which bear their very minute seeds on the backs of their \r\nleaves, that are conspicuous by the microscope; these are subdivided according to their leaves, as \r\nthey are whole, entire and undivided; or variously cut, laciniated, pinnate, and ramose. Of this \r\nkind are the Ferns, The Spleenworts, Polypodies, maiden hairs etc. which have nothing like a flower \r\nThe 4th treats of such herbs as have an imperfect or stamineous flower \r\ncommonly call\u2019d apetalose, because it is not composed of petala, or tender fugacious coloured \r\nleaves, only of a calyx or cup, of stamina or capillaments or styles; these are subdivided \r\ninto such whose fruits are not contiguous to their flowers, as in Hops, Hemp, Nettles, Spinache, Mercury,\r\nPalma Christi; the American physick nut etc. II into such that have a triguetrous or triangular \r\nseed, as the Docks, Sorrells, Arsmarts, Knotgrass, Snakeweeds. III into those that have round, compres\u2019d \r\nand otherwise figured seeds, as the Pondweeds, Orrackes, Sea Purslane, the Blites, the Amaranthi,\r\nthe Beets, some Kales etc.\r\nThe 5th Book begins with those that have a perfect planifolious flower, or tender co \r\nloured petala, or leaves, that make up a compound flower; these are I either lactescent, mil \r\nky, and pappose, containing their seeds in a lanugo or downy substance, as the Lettices,\r\nSow thistles, succorys, Hawkweeds, Mouse-ears, Dandelyons, Scorzonera\u2019s or Viper-grass, Goats beard, etc. \r\nII such as have solid seeds without any pappus or lanugo, as Endive, Nipplewort, and some succorys.\r\nthese are lactescent.\r\nThe 6th contains the Herbs that are not milky, and yet bear their \r\nseeds in a downy or pappose substance, succeeding the flowers; these have either radiated, \r\ndiscose, and flat flowers, as Colts-foot, the Coryza\u2019s or Fleabanes, Elecampane, The star-worts,\r\nthe Leopards banes, the Golden Rods, the staecha\u2019s, the Jacobaea\u2019s or Ragworts; or else the flower is \r\ndisposed into a thyrsus or spike, as in the Petasitis or Butterbur. \r\nThe 7th is of the capitate Herbs, whose flowers are fistular, and whose seeds \r\nare included in a squamose calyx or cup, conglobated into a head, fill\u2019d with a pappus of \r\nthis kind are the Blew-Bottles, saw-wort, the Jacea\u2019s or Knapweeds, the great Centory, the great Burr-\r\ndock, and most of the Thistles, which are subdivided according to their heads, flowers m prickles,\r\nspots, consistence of their leaves, etc.\r\nThe 8th comprehends the corymbiferous, that are not pappose, these have \r\neither a radiated, or a naked flower, and are subdivided according to the colours of the barbulae \r\nand discus, and from the figures the flowers make - of this Tribe are the sun flowers, the ",
