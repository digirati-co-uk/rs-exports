But move Southward \r\nInclining that way.\r\nI should have taken notice in the proper place that when one Bee goes home from the sugar \r\nplate. He Returns with a Considerable Number from the hive.\r\nThis account was sent from New England by Paul Dudley Esqr.\r\nto be communicated to the Royall Society, June the 30th. 1720",
