The fourth set hath the 4th and 5th places emty for \r\nwant of words to expres their sounds in, and therefore must \r\nbe instanced by the expression of the mouth it self, yet \r\nmay they easily be conceived, to wit, in the fourth set the \r\n4th and 5th not expressed by considering the expression of \r\nthose of those numbers in the other 3 sets for the same \r\nvariation as have the 4th and 5th sounds in the said 3 \r\nsets to the first of each, the same variation are the 4th and 5th \r\nwanting in the fourth set to have, in relation to the first \r\nof that set, The same is to be observed in the 3 first \r\nsounds wanting in the 5th and 6th set \r\nNB.
