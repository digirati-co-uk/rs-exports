F.R.S.\r\n\r\nIt was some Time since that in a Letter \r\nto One of the Members of this Society, I gave an Account \r\nof the Severall Strata of Earths and Mineralls found in \r\nsome of the Coal Works in <u>Somersetshire <\\u>, which was printed \r\nin One of Your Transactions. But there is one great \r\nError in the Print, for whereas I said that in those Parts \r\nthey never meet with <u>Freestone <\\u> over the Coal, the Printer \r\nby Mistake calls it <u>Firestone <\\u>, whereas <u>Firestone <\\u> is \r\nalways found in those Mines, contrary to the Works in \r\n<u>Staffordshire<\\u>, <u>Newcastle <\\u>, and <u>Scotland <\\u> , where <u>Freestone <\\u>\r\ndoes indeed lye over the Coal. I have farther observed the \r\n<u>Strata<\\u> of Stone, Clay, and Marle, of the interjacent Hills,\r\nwhere, under the black Marle, lyes a Spongy, Yellowish Earth,\r\nAll this lyes above the Red Soyl which I have said is gene-\r\n-rally the Surface of the Valleys where the Coal is found. And \r\nas this Red Mould on the Surface degenerates in to Malm\r\nor Loom, so towards the North West, beyond or without the \r\nVeins of Coal, about <u>Winford <\\u> in the same County, it turns \r\nto Ruddle or Red Okre, used cheifly for marking of Sheep, \r\nand for ground Colours or primeing, insteed of Spanish \r\nBrown, and often Counterfeits Bol.Armon.\r\nBut as I never heard any Coal was found to the West or \r\nSouth of Mendip hills, so <u>Cotswold <\\u> to the North East, and \r\nthe Chalk Hills of Marlboro Downs and Salisbury Plains \r\nseem to sett Bounds to the Coal Country to the East and South ",
