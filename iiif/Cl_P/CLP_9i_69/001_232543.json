West. viz. from the dip to the rise, & Fig: 2d at right Angles from \r\nSouth East, of which Fig: 1st. may be supposed a Section from South \r\n=West to North East on the Drift or levell.\r\nI mention this by Way of Correction and Addition to my \r\nformer Observations of the Coal Works in <u> Somersetshire <\\u> . I have \r\nsince had Oppertunities to be underGround and view severall \r\nCoal Works in <u>Scotland <\\u> and <u>Northumberland <\\u>, and to observe \r\nthe several <u>Strata <\\u> there. At <u>Widdrington<\\u> they have four \r\nFathom Clay, then a Seam of Coal about 6 Inches thick, not \r\nworth working, then a white Freestone, then an hard Stone \r\nwhich they call a Whin, then Two Fathom of Clay, then a \r\nwhite soft Stone, and under that a Vein of Coal three feet,\r\nnine Inches thick; This is a small Coal of the same Nature,\r\nbut not so good, as the <u>Newcastle Coal <\\u> which comes to London \r\nMerket; These Veins dip to the South East one Yard in Twenty.\r\nNear <u>Tranent <\\u> in <u>East Lothian in Scotland <\\u>, the Coal dips also \r\nto the South East in the Same Proportion; but at <u>Baldoc <\\u> in \r\nthe Parish of <u>Campsy <\\u> 3 miles from <u>Kylsith <\\u> it dips to the \r\nNorth East, and at <u>Madestone <\\u> near <u>Falkirk <\\u> to the Same \r\nPoint and in the same Proportion. The <u>Strata <\\u> of Earths and \r\nMinerals at these Places agree very near; They have as the \r\nGround rises or falls, One, Two, or Three Fathom of Clay,\r\nthen Eleven Fathom of Sclate or Coal Clives, One Fathom \r\nof Limestone, under that 2 fathom of Sclate, Earth, and Stone \r\nand then Coal; And all these agree in this, that the Pitts \r\ngenerally need no Timber, and have a good Roof which is \r\nsupported by Pillars of Coal which they leave in the working.\r\nAt <u>Baldoe <\\u> the Coal is commonly 45 Inches thick, and all along ",
