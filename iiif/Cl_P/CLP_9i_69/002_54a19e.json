And to the North West and North, in the \r\nDrift of the Coal in higher Ground, and consequently lying \r\nover it, there appear in the Sides of the Hills, Seams of Sparr and \r\nLead, the Drift of which is North East and lyes almost perpen \r\n-dicular, but what Obliquity there is pitches to the South East.\r\nAt <u>Auchenclaugh <\\u> Six Miles East from <u>Kylsith <\\u> there is a Coal \r\n18 feet thick; this dips one foot in three, and is not pursued by \r\nReason of Water, and for want of a Merket will not quit the \r\ncost of draining.
