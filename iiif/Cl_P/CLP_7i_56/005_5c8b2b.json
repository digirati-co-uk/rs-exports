The \r\nSamballoes to ye river Conception is comanded by one Corbet who is altogether in ye French \r\ninterest, and we have the following accompt of him About 7 years agoe yr being a \r\nbundance of privateers about ye Samballoes, this Corbet & they contracted a particular \r\nfreindship & he did ym many good offices, they in return told him, if he wold go to Petit \r\nGuavas ye Governor yt Monsr de Cass wold make him amends for all his favours to ym, he \r\nresolved upon it & away he goes in a French vessel & chanced to be taken by an English \r\nprivateer & caryed to Jamaica where he & 2 Indians wer sold as slaves: As soon as \r\nMonsr de Cass was informd of this he sends to ye governor of Jamaica who at his desire \r\nreleasd ym & sent ym to Petit Guavas from whence they took ye opportunity of a pri \r\nvateer bound to ye Samballoes & returned home They wer prissoners in Jamaica 7 mo \r\nneths Corbet continued rambleing wt ye privateers & took another trip to Petit Guavas \r\nwher he had not been long befor Monsr Pointy arrived wt whom he went to Cartagena \r\nwho gave him goods to ye value of 2000 crowns & Monsr de Cass who accompa \r\nnied Monsr Pointi in yt expedition gave him a comission as General of all ye French & Indian \r\nforces on ye coast of Darien, to take, sink & destroy ye Spanish or any other ennemy not \r\nwt standing comission both ye French & most sensible Indians have no opinion either of \r\nhis capacity, courage or constancy, for he has a correspondence under hand wt ye Spa \r\nniards yt they doe not like, but Ambrosio whom all own to be ye most dareing & \r\nbrave as well as ye most faithfull to his promise keeps him w\u2019in bounds.\r\nNext to Corbet from ye river Conception is one Nicola who speaks Spanish as well as \r\na natural Spaniard haveing been for about 12 years in his youth among ym he like \r\nwise reads & writs it perfectly & understands ye affairs of Europe very well, which none \r\nof ye rest have any notion of, he is Sd to be wise & brave extreamly beloved by his \r\npeople for his justice & good nature This Nicola was in good terms wt ye Spaniards till \r\nabout a 12 moneth agoe a trifle made him break wt ym, & it was thus, he had \r\ngott an excellent French fuzil from a Buccaneer qch he valued extreamly it was \r\nsomewhat out of order nor did he know how to put it to rights again A Spanish \r\nDon from Porto Bello being at his house told him he wold carry it wt him & get it \r\nmended for him. The Don shewed it to ye Governor who liked it extreamly & said \r\nit was too good for a Heathen who kept correspondence wt the French so he ordered an \r\nold rustie match lock to be sent in Place of it, this he took so heinously yt he \r\nfell upon ye Spaniard wherever he found ym & cut ym of nor is he to be reconciled to \r\nmy Thus we parted wt ye French man whom we treated wt all possible civility, they \r\nwent home to Ambrosio\u2019s & promised to return in 5 or 6 days.\r\n10.
