It remains therefore but to know the proportion \r\nof the gravity of <s>the <\\s> Air to that of water: and we have \r\nfound it to be always not the same: because the heigth, the \r\nheat, and the moisture of the Atmosphaere are variable:\r\nnevertheless we may say in general that the reason between \r\nthe specifick gravitys of Water and Air is much about 840. [text?]\r\ntaking then their square root\u2019s, as I have say\u2019d above, which \r\nroot\u2019s are 29. and 1. we may conclude that the velocity of \r\nAir must exceed that of water by 29 times: and so \r\nmultiplying 44 velocity of water by 29 we <s>will <\\s> shall find that the \r\nVelocity of Air driven by the whole pressure of the Atmosphaere \r\nis about 1364 foot in a second.",
