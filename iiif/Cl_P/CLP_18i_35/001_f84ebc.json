Thus, quick silver being 13 1/2 times heavier \r\nthen water, bear\u2019s as much pressure when it\u2019s spring is one foot \r\n<s>high, as wat  <\\s> above the spout hole, as water doth when it\u2019s \r\nspring is 13 1/2 foot high, and the heigth to which Mercury shall \r\nascend will be 13 1/2 times lesser than the heigth to which water \r\nshall be driven by those equall pressures.\r\nProposition.2.\r\nFrom the foregoing Proposition another may easily be deduced \r\n<u>viz<\\u> that Of differing liquor\u2019s bearing the same pressure \r\nthose that are lighter <u>in specie <\\u> must acquire a greater \r\nswiftness, and their differing velocity\u2019s are to one another \r\nas the root\u2019s of the specifick gravity\u2019s of the say\u2019d liquors.\r\nFor we have seen Prop.1. that the heigth\u2019s to be attain\u2019d are \r\nin the same reason as the specifick gravity\u2019s; Now <u>Galileus,\r\nHugenius <\\u>, and <s>Mr Hally <\\s> others have demonstrated that the Velocity\u2019s \r\nof body\u2019s are to one another as the square root\u2019s of the heigth\u2019s \r\nto which they may ascend: and so in this occasion they are also \r\nas the root\u2019s of the specifick gravity\u2019s.\r\nIf therefore we will know what is the velocity of the Air \r\nbeing driven by any degree of pressure whatsoever, we ought \r\nbut to find what would be the velocity of water under the \r\nsame pressure: and then take the square root\u2019s of the specifick \r\ngravity\u2019s of these two liquor\u2019s, because as much as the square \r\nroot of the specifick gravity of water, will exceed the \r\nsquare root of the specifick gravity of Air, so much in \r\nproportion will the velocity of Air exceed the velocity of \r\nwater. For example, when I have computed what should \r\nbe the swiftness of a bullet shott by the pneumatick engine,\r\nas hath been described in the Philosophical Transactions,\r\nI should first compute what was the velocity of the Air itself ",
