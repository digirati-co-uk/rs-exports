A Paper \r\nOf y<sup>e<\\sup> Honourable Robt Boyls deposited with y<sup>e<\\sup> secretarys \r\nOf y<sup>e<\\sup> Royal Society Oct. 14. 1680 & opened since his death being An Account of his \r\nway of making y<sup>e<\\sup> Phosphorus &c.\r\nThere was taken a <u>Considerable quan=\r\ntity <\\u> of <u>Man\u2019s Urine <\\u> because y<sup>e<\\sup> Liquor yeilds \r\nbut a small proportion of y<sup>e<\\sup> desired <u>quintes-\r\nseance<\\u>: and of this a good part at least, had been \r\nfor a pretty while digested before it was used.\r\nThen this liquor was distil\u2019d w<sup>th<\\sup> moderate \r\nheat, till y<sup>e<\\sup> <u> spirituous <\\u> or <u>saline <\\u> parts were \r\ndrawn off; after w<sup>ch<\\sup> y<sup>e<\\sup> <u>superfluous <\\u> moisture \r\nalsoe was abstracted (or evaporated away) till\r\ny<sup>e<\\sup> remaineing  substance was brought to y<sup>e<\\sup> con\r\nsistence of a some what thick <u>syrup <\\u> or a thin \r\n<u>extract <\\u>. This done, it was well incorporated w<sup>th<\\sup>\r\nthrice it\u2019s weight of fine <u>white sand <\\u>; and y<sup>e<\\sup> mixture \r\nbeing put into a strong stone <u>Retort <\\u>, to w<sup>ch<\\sup> a\r\nLarg <u>Receiver <\\u> (in good part filld with water,) was\r\nso Joynd, y<sup>t<\\sup> y<sup>e<\\sup> nose of y<sup>e<\\sup> <u>Retort <u> did almost touch y<sup>e<\\sup> \r\nwater: then y<sup>e<\\sup> two Vessells being carefully luted \r\ntogether m a naked fire was gradually administred \r\nfor 5 or 6 hours, that all that was either <u>Phlegma=\r\n=tick<\\u> or <u>Volatile <u> might come over first. When \r\nthis was done, y<sup>e<\\sup> fire was increasd; & at length \r\nfor 5 or 6 hours made as strong & intense as the \r\nfurnace (w<sup>ch<\\sup> was not bad,) was capable of giveing \r\n(w<sup>ch<\\sup> Violence of fire is a circumstance not to be\r\nomitted in this operation). By this means there \r\ncame over good store of white fumes, almost \r\nlike those that appear in the Distillation of\r\noyle of <u>Vitriol<\\u>; & when those fumes were past,\r\n& y<sup>e<\\sup> <u>receiver <u> grew cleare they were after a \r\nwhile succeeded by another sort that seem\u2019d\r\nin y<sup>e<\\sup> <u>Receiver <u> to give a faint bluish light, almost like that of little burning matches\r\ndip\u2019d in Sulphur. And last of all, y<sup>e<\\sup> fire being \r\nvery Vehement, there pas\u2019d over another sub=\r\n=stance, y<sup>t<\\sup> was Judg\u2019d more ponderous then y<sup>e<\\sup> \r\nformer because it fell through y<sup>e<\\sup> water to\r\ny<sup>e<\\sup> bottome of the <u>Receiver<u>; whence being \r\ntaken out (& partly even whilst it stay\u2019d there \r\nit) appear\u2019d by severall Effects and other Phae \r\n=nomena, to be such a kind of substance \r\nas we\r\ndesired and expected.",
