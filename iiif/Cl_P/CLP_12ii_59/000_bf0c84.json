They have in some manner \r\nrecourse to your Tribunal: for where can they be \r\nexamined with such judgement? This is my motive \r\nfor communicating to you the figure of an uncommon \r\nStone found lately in the bladder of a dead Body,\r\nwhich I had engraved in my own presence . Tis exactly \r\nconformable to the Original. The most able Physicians \r\nand the best Anatomists, whom I have consulted on \r\nthis Subject, assure me they never saw any thing like \r\nit of the kind. I can vouch that the Engraving tho\u2019 \r\nvery exact, does not come up to this singular work of \r\nNature; the ten branches of which, that depart from \r\nthe Center, have some resemblance with those of certain \r\nplants. It is a matter of difficulty to me to think that \r\nthe System of Juxt-Apposition, which is employ\u2019d to explain \r\nthe successive growth of common stones or Calculi,\r\ncan hold good on this occasion. I dare not however \r\nadvance, that Vegetation has any share herein: tho\u2019 \r\nthe shapes of the branches of the Stone, of the <s>Pipes <\\s> Canals,\r\nor <s>Nipples <\\s> Papillae, which <s>appear <\\s> seem destined to convey the nutritious juices ",
