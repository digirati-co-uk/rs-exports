Oughtreds sheet annough, and may be reduced \r\nto 2. heads.\r\nFirst, if ye Projection be considered only, wthout \r\nye Common dyal and its Cock or Style, then it \r\nserves as an Instrument, to give ye suns place, de\r\nclinaon, time of rising and setting, length of ye \r\nday, and ye amplitude of ye Sun etc.\r\nBut this dyal differs from M. Oughtreds , in\r\nye placing of ye days of ye month, wch, in his, are \r\nset to ye Ecliptick in ye midle of ye projection,\r\nbut here stand at ye ends of ye parallels of de\r\nclinaon, at ye Horizon, and by counting their num\r\nber from ye day of ye month to ye Eqnoctiall\r\nye declinaon of ye [sun symbol] is known; ye houre-line,\r\npassing through ye day of ye month, shows ye\r\n time of rising and setting, and ye arch of ye \r\nHorizon against ye day of ye month shows ye \r\namplitude.\r\n",
