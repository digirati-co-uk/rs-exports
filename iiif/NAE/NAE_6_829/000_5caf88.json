The morning was not very fine, so they did not commence until afternoon. At 8 a.m. the ship was \u2018dressed\u2019,  a string of flags was hoisted on each mast, and a silk Union Jack (presented by Sir George Nares K.C.B.) was hoisted on Hut Point. At noon a Royal Salute was fired with 21 distress rockets. After dinner the following events were run off: toboggan race, weight putting, sledge dragging on foot (six men to a team, 200 lbs per man, half a mile), \u2018Ski\u2019 running down slope, and a tug of war. Some events have been postponed until Saturday next.\r\n",
