We now, therefore, approach Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment with a definite scheme, and, in place of help hitherto\r\nrefused by the Australian Governments, we offer a sum of \u00a340,000\r\nalready subscribed in this country, which is sufficient to pay a\r\nconsiderable portion of the cost of an expedition.  We only ask that\r\nthis sum may be adequately increased by a Government grant.\r\n    This is the first time that the Royal Society and the Royal\r\nGeographical Society, aided by other scientific bodies, have combined\r\nto organize and despatch an expedition.  Such an undertaking is\r\noutside their ordinary duties, and they entered upon it with a serious\r\nsense of the responsibilities it will entail, but with a strong feeling\r\nthat, under the circumstances, no other alternative was left to them.\r\nThis, therefore, is in no sense a private enterprise, while its objects\r\nare precisely identical with those of the many polar expeditions\r\ndespatched or subsidized by the Government, as shown in the\r\nannexed list.  Its national and representative character is emphasized\r\nby His royal Highness the Prince of Wales having consented to be\r\nPatron, and His Royal Highness the Duke of York to be Vice-Patron\r\nof the expedition.\r\n   An appeal which has been received from the scientific bodies of\r\nGermany to co-operate with a German expedition (for the equipment\r\nof which the Reichstag has been asked to vote \u00a350,000, supplementing\r\na large public subscription), renders it still more incumbent upon us\r\nto commence our preparations without delay.  There can be no doubt\r\nthat, considering the modest scale of both expeditions, such co-opera-\r\ntion would be most desirable.  In more than one branch of scientific\r\ninvestigation simultaneous observations at distant points near the\r\nsame parallels, if not essential, will largely increase the value of the\r\nresults. It is obvious that in many ways the co-operation of the\r\nEnglish and German ships will have a tendency to reduce the cost.\r\n    ",

In more than one branch of scientific\r\ninvestigation simultaneous observations at distant points near the\r\nsame parallels, if not essential, will largely increase the value of the\r\nresults. It is obvious that in many ways the co-operation of the\r\nEnglish and German ships will have a tendency to reduce the cost.\r\n    On the grounds of policy alone, we submit that this is not a time\r\nfor our country, so long the mother of discovery and of maritime\r\nenterprise, to abdicate her leading position.  From the results of our\r\nexploring expeditions in past times, not only the naval service and\r\nthe country, but the whole civilised world have derived benefit.  It\r\nis certainly the desire of the people of this country that her glorious\r\ntraditions should be maintained.\r\n    The expedition will probably last from two to three years, and\r\namong its principal objects will be geographical exploration of the\r\nunknown region, the taking magnetic, meteorological, and biological\r\nobservations, and deep sea sounding and dredging.\r\n    We do not, however, propose to enter upon a detailed statement of\r\nthe scientific results in this letter, since we enclose, for the informa-\r\ntion of your Lordships, a memorandum containing an explanation\r\nof the objects of the expedition.  But we may observe that the\r\nmost important work, and the work which will be of the greatest\r\npractical utility, is that connected with terrestrial magnetism, and\r\nthat the requirements of magnetic observations necessitate the\r\nbuilding of a specially-constructed vessel.\r\n    The cost of an Antarctic Expedition cannot be exactly estimated\r\nuntil tenders have been received for building the ship based on\r\ndrawings and specifications, nor until it is known how long the\r\nexpedition can be employed.  This must depend on the funds.  But\r\nallowing for three years, the estimate for an expedition such as it\r\nwould be desirable to equip, would amount approximately to \u00a3100,000.\r\n\r\n       \u00a3                                                                                                                             \r\n    Building a suitable vessel ... ... ...  35,000\r\n    Fittings, &c   ... ... ... ... ... 4,000\r\n    Salaries and wages, three years .. ... 20,000\r\n    Provisions      ... ... ... ... ... 8,000\r\n    Clothing, outfits   ... ... ... ... 7,000\r\n    Coals and stores    ... ... ... ... 10,000\r\n    Landing party   ... ... ... ... ... 6,000\r\n    Contingencies   ... ... ... ... ... 10,000\r\n________\r\n\u00a3100,000\r\n________\r\n\r\n    The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have undertaken to\r\nfurnish the scientific instruments.\r\n    We thus submit, the the consideration of Her Majesty's Government,\r\nour scheme and our estimate, and we enclose a statement of the\r\nvaluable results which we hope to secure.  It is a national enterprise,\r\nsupported on good grounds by all the scientific bodies of the Empire,\r\nand we request the Government to supplement our fund of \u00a340,000\r\nby proposing a Parliamentary grant sufficient to complete the",
