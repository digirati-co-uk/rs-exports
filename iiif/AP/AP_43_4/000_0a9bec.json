Received Aug. 28. 1869 Read \r\nNov 24/60 \r\nCommunicated by Sir B. Brodie Bart Pres. R.S. \r\nIn investigating the physiological anatomy \r\nof the lungs, it is convenient to make a cursory examination of the external and general fea=\r\n=tures of those organs, before entering upon \r\nthe consideration of their minute structure \r\nPleura First as regards the Pleura \r\nThe general characteristics of this structure \r\nand the mode in which it is distributed, so \r\nas to enclose and protect the lungs, and to render \r\nthem detached and insulated from other organs, \r\nmay be inferred with sufficient accuracy from \r\nthe descriptions given in ordinary anatomical \r\nworks. Two remarkable circumstances must \r\nhowever be noticed: viz that the blood-vessels \r\nwhich are actually distributed to the tissue of \r\nthe Pleura are exclusively derived from the Pul=\r\n=monary system of blood-vessels. This fact will \r\nestablish the truth that the function which the \r\nPleura itself is called upon to discharge is wholly \r\nand exclusively connected with the process of \r\n'Respiration'; since the evidences which this \r\npaper will bring to notice, establish beyond the ",
