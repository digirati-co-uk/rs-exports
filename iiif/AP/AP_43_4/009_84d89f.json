They are spread \r\nover the surface of the lungs in n intricate \r\nmeshwork and form larger vessels, which run \r\nin a straight direction across the sub-pleural \r\ntissue to reach the posterior mediastinum - \r\nNerves. \r\nIn the sub-pleural tissue also, the termination \r\nof the nerves derived from the pulmonary plexus are to be \r\ndistinguished. The nerves from this plexus are \r\ndistributed to every part of the lungs, and in \r\ntheir ramifications correspond very closely with \r\nthose of the Bronchial artery - It is clear and beyond ",
