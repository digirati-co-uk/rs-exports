It will be impossible to impart \r\nanything like the same depth of colour to the \r\nmucous membrane, by any amount of injection \r\nby the Broncial artery, and it is only by the most \r\ncomplete injection possible of this latter artery, that \r\nany vessels in communication with it can be made to shew themselves ",
