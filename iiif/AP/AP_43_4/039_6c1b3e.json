These difficulties are not met with, at least to any considerable extent, when all the vessels are injected with Vermilion, because that is a material, which is not liable to lose its colour, when solvent fluids are used to clear away the superfluous sui. \r\nApparatus necessary\r\nThe apparatus, by which the specimens were made, from which the facts produced in this paper were elicited, consisted of two pumps of equal dimensions, each fitted with a solid brass plunger, ground to fit its barrel. They were made to fix firmly to the table and each pump was furnished with a distinct suction and delivery pipe. The piston of each was made to lift by means of a lever handle, and both of these handles were so bent that they could be lifted by one hand at the same moment. By raising the handles each barrel was filled with a fluid of a particular colour and by letting the handles descend by their own weight, or with such additional weight as it was thought proper to attach to either of the levers or to both, the fluids were driven onwards with a vis a tergo, not exceeding the weight of the pistons with their handles; the purpose therefore, which was made on ",
