The reason of this is that the \r\nyellow injection readily penetrates capillaries, \r\nwhich the red injection can only with difficulty \r\nbe made to enter and after the injection has been \r\nmade the yellow vessels shew themselves more vividly \r\nin contrast with the red. From this it will be \r\nseen, that it depends upon the circumstance as \r\nto which of the two has been subjected to the prepon=\r\n=derating pressure to determine whether the injected \r\ncapillaries rather partake of the colour of that which \r\nis propelled into the arteries or of that sent into the \r\nveins - Having made these preliminary arrange=\r\n",
