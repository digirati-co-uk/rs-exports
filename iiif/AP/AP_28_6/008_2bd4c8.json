Now \r\nit is exactly in the direction in which they do not \r\nbend, that the filaments of the feather have to encounter \r\nthe resistance and impulse of the air; it is here, that \r\nstrength has been wanted, and it is here, that strength \r\nhas been bestowed.\u201d Bridgewater Treatise, Vol. 1.:p. 569. \r\nThe motion of the spine forwards is prevented by \r\nstrong flat ligaments, in color very like the ligamentum \r\nnuchae, which is situated between each spinous process, \r\nand attached to the thin edge of each, the whole of its \r\nlength. The long flat bones, which I have just des-\r\ncribed, exert their influence too, in restraining the \r\nforward motion of the spine; and in some birds, as \r\nthe ",
