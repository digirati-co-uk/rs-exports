The dorsal and sacral vertebrae on the contrary, even when \r\nthey are not consolidated are connected by strong ligaments so as \r\nto form an inflexible column (In the Ostrich and cassowary alone the \r\ndorsal vertebrae are moveable). This dosposition on the one hand by the \r\nsolidity it affords to the trunk facilitates the flight of the bird and on \r\nthe other by the length and flexibility of the neck in some degree \r\ncompensates for the incapability of the anterior extremities for seizing \r\nand feeling objects. Of the dorsal vertebrae the two first which support \r\nthe false ribs (though there is sometimes only one of them) are \r\nsomewhat moveable, and have a general resemblance to the cervical \r\nvertebrae.\u201d\r\nThe muscles of the back are not mentioned by Carus. \r\nAn Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of Animals &c. \r\ntranslated by R.
