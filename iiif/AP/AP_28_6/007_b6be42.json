In these birds, there is \r\nanother point in which the skeleton differs from that \r\nof birds of flight; the pubic bones are united, as in \r\nthe mammalia, affording stability and firmness to the \r\npelvis, so necessary in running. \r\nThere are beautiful contrivances to prevent motion \r\nin an antero-posterior, whilst they readily admit it \r\nin a lateral direction. The spinous processes of the \r\nvertebrae, which project at right angles from the bodies \r\nof the vertebrae, <s>and<\\s> are situated exactly in a line with \r\neach other, having but a very small space between \r\neach. And in many cases, there are thin long flat bones, \r\nwhich are placed with their flat surfaces applied to \r\neach side of the spinous processes, preventing motion in \r\na backward direction. These flat bones serve the pur-\r\npose of tendons, as the muscular fibres are attached to \r\nthem ",
