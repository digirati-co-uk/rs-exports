Many molluscs, Crustaceans and \r\nprincipally Insects present to us a gre[at]\r\nmany examples of it. \r\nAs such in the group of the Molluscs \r\nLamellibranchiata we find the constantly \r\nsitting Ostreida, between which exist or\r\nganisms most compound of all the group;\r\n- organisms with well develloped eyes. In\r\nCrustacea we can indicate the group of\r\nCyrrhipedia to which belong higher deve \r\nloped and the larger organisms of the lo\r\nwest forms of the whole classes. In In[secta?]\r\nwe find so often the exampls of social \r\nlife in almost all tribes and famili[es]\r\nand principally between the Hymenopt[era]\r\nwhere this life is builed on the physio \r\nlogical division of labour. This division \r\nwe must also consider as a progre[sive?]\r\nstep in the development.",
