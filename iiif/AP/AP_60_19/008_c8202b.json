In the group of Polyps we see \r\nthat colonial forms more or less concen-\r\ntrated preceded the solitary Malacodermata -\r\n- it is to say - the forms more compound \r\nof whole class. In the strange group \r\nof Tunicata we find the colonial forms \r\nbetween the compound <u>Ascidias <\\u> and these \r\nforms gave doubtless the origine to more \r\ndeveloped and larger forms of compli-\r\ncated <u>Ascidias <\\u>.\r\nThe colonial forms of Bryozoa gave the \r\nmore developed and large forms of <u>Loxo-\r\nsoma <\\u> and we can suppose that some \r\nforms of Worms (as a <u>Foronis <\\u>) arose \r\nfrom such a great group. We can \r\nsuppose also that some forms of Pla-\r\nnaria find their origin in the same group \r\nof Worms in very little colonial pa-\r\nrasites as a form discovered by professor \r\n<u>Owsjannikow <\\u> in the eggs of Sturionida.\r\nWith these forms conclude the series \r\nof colonial organisms and following hi-\r\ngher groups complicate themselves by \r\nsimple solitary forms, but bound in tem-\r\nporal or constant society.\r\nIf we will resume all these facts we \r\ncan make the following general conclusions.\r\n1o The developement of forms in lowest ani-\r\nmal\u2019s life principally becomes by means of \r\nthe colonial forms, which are undergoing the \r\nlaw of concentration of organs.\r\n",
