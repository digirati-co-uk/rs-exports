Huxley F.R.S.\r\nReceived April 1. 1892 Read June 16 1892\r\nIn continuing his researches on the physiology of \r\nthe <u>Invertebrata <\\u>, the author gives the following \r\naccount of the alimentary canal of the larva and \r\nimago of <u>Pontia brassicae <\\u>>, which has not been in-\r\nvestigated by other workers.\r\nThe alimentary canal of the larva (Fig.1) begins with \r\nan oral aperture which opens into a pharynx lined \r\nby a dark, firm cuticula. Behind the oral aperture \r\nis a projecting process, at the tip of which opens the \r\nsalivary duct. There are a pair of these ducts which \r\nproceed from two well-developed salivary glands.\r\nThese glands form elongated tubes, gradually dimin-\r\nishing in diameter towards the posterior ends. The \r\noesophagus is very narrow and short. It leads\r\ninto a long stomach, which opens into a short duct.",
