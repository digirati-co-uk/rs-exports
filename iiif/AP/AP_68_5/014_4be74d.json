Is it possible that the Malpighian \r\ntubules had originally the function of a liver?++\r\nThis is improbable, but it is well known that an \r\norgan may lose its original function, and yet \r\npersist because it is of use for some other \r\npurpose: one of these predominates at one \r\ntime, another at another, and the organ may \r\nundergo structural modification in con-\r\nsequence.\r\nThe author has found no trace of an organ in the \r\n<u>Invertebrata <\\u>, which answers physiologically to \r\nthe liver of the <u>Vertebrata <\\u>; although it may be \r\nremarked that Blundstone (<u>Proc. Roy. Soc.<\\u>, vol. \r\n38, p.442) states that the connective-tissue-cells in\r\nthe <u>Mollusca<\\u> have a glycogenic function; and it is \r\nprobable that this function may be performed by special \r\ncells in other forms of the <u>Invertebrata <\\u>.",
