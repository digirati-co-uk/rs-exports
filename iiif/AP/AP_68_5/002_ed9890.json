The stomach has an epithelium lining,\r\nwhich is thrown up into folds so as to form im-\r\nperfectly differentiated glandular follicles. After\r\nremoving the epithelium, the characteristic arrange-\r\nment of the muscular fibres is readily seen under \r\nthe microscope (Fig.3). There is an internal layer,\r\ncomposed of a large number of fibres, running trans-\r\nversely around the stomach and more or less parallel \r\nto one another. Outside are the longitudinal striped \r\nmuscles, which are distributed in single bundles,\r\nand do not form a continuous layer. Each bundle \r\nis composed of a number of fibres and pursues \r\nits own course; the bundles are not parallel, but \r\nsometimes two bundles unite, or are connected \r\nby a third; their general direction is longitudinal.\r\nNumerous tracheal branches penetrate the muscular \r\nlayers, and ramify both through them and the ",
