On the addition of alcohol to the filtrate,\r\nthe ferment is precipitated. The action of this ferment \r\non starch was the complete conversion of the latter \r\ninto glucose. The action of the ferment on fibrin was \r\nthe formation of leucin and tyrosin; for on treat-\r\ning the fermented mass with hot water and filter-\r\ning, a solution was obtained which contained \r\nleucin and tyrosin. When acetic acid was added \r\nto this solution, acicular crystals were deposited.\r\nThese crystals were insoluble in ether, but soluble \r\nin boiling water. The aqueous solution produced \r\na red flocculent precipitate on the addition of a \r\nneutral solution of mercuric nitrate; this re-\r\naction is characteristic of tyrosin.\r\nThe acetic acid solution, after precipitating the \r\ntyrosin, was evaporated, when leucin was deposited \r\nin white shining plates. These crystals of leucin \r\nwere heated with barium oxide - the result ",
