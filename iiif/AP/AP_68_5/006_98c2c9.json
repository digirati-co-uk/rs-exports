This conclusion has been arrived at by \r\nthe following experiments:-\r\n(a) A small portion of the stomach was placed on \r\nstarch paste. The starch granules disappeared, with \r\nthe exception of the celluloid covering, and on \r\ntreating with water, and testing the solution with \r\nFehling\u2019s solution, sugar in the dextrose form was \r\nfound.\r\nIt may be remarked that according to Jousset de \r\nBellesme* the secretion of the salivary glands of <u>Peri-\r\nplaneta (Blatta) orientalis <\\u> is alone able to convert \r\nstarch into dextrose.
