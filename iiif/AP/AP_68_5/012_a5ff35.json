The uric acid was extracted by \r\nboiling a large number of them in water, filtering,\r\nand then evaporating the filtrate to dryness. The \r\nresidue was treated with alcohol, filtered, and \r\nthe residue so formed was dissolved in boiling \r\nwater to which acetic acid was added. After \r\nstanding for several hours, crystals of uric acid \r\nwere deposited. These crystals were readily con-\r\nverted into murexide.\r\nWhen a fresh Malpighian tubule of <u>Pontia <\\u> was placed \r\nupon a slide under the microscope, and crushed,\r\na drop of acetic acid added, and the whole covered \r\nby a cover-glass, rhombic and other crystalline \r\nforms were deposited. These crystals were also \r\nreadily converted into murexide by the action of \r\nnitric acid and ammonia.\r\nNo other substance besides uric acid is present in the \r\nMalpighian tubules of <u>Pontia brassicae <\\u>.*\r\n[*] The Malpighian tubules of both the larva and imago were \r\ntested separately, but with the same result.",
