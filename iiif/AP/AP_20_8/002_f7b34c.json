Under the patronage \r\nof the Governments of France, of Prussia, of Denmark \r\nand of Russia magnetical observatories have been \r\nestablished at Paris, at Berlin, in the mines of Freyberg, \r\nat Copenhagen, in Iceland, at St Petersburg, Kasan, \r\nMoscow, Barnoul at the foot of the Altai chain, Nertschinsk \r\nnear the frontier of China, even at Pekin, and at Nicolajeff \r\nin Crimea. \r\nM. de Humboldt states that the lines represent\r\ning the horary variations at Berlin, Freyberg, Petersburg \r\nand Nicolajeff affect parallelism, notwithstanding the \r\ngreat separation of the stations and the influence \r\nof extraordinary perturbations: that this however is \r\nnot invariable, since even at small distances, for \r\nexample, at Berlin and in the mines of Freyberg, one \r\nof the needles may shew considerable perturbations, \r\nwhile the other continues that regular course which \r\nis a function of the solar time of the place. \r\nThe epochs which it had been proposed \r\nthat simultaneous observations should be made at \r\nall stations were, \r\n20<sup>th<\\sup> and 21<sup>st> March\r\n4<sup>th<\\sup> and 5<sup>th<\\sup> May \r\n21<sup>st<\\sup> and 22<sup>nd<\\sup> of June \r\n6<sup>th<\\sup> and 7<sup>th<\\sup> of August \r\n23<sup>rd<\\sup> and 24<sup>th<\\sup> of September \r\n5<sup>th<\\sup> and 6<sup>th<\\sup> of November \r\n21<sup>st<\\sup> and 22<sup>nd<\\sup> of December } from 4<sup>h<\\sup> in the morning of \r\nthe first day until midnight \r\nof the second, observing, at least, \r\nhourly, night and day, at \r\neach magnetic station: \r\nbut \r\n",
