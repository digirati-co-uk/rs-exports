Now, he observes, simple observations of \r\nhorary variation or of magnetic intensity, made \r\nat places far distant from each other, reveal to us \r\nwhat passes at great depths in the interior of our \r\nplanet or in the upper reaches of our atmosphere: \r\nthose luminous emanations, those polar explosions \r\nwhich accompany the \"<u>Magnetic Storm<\\u>\" appear to \r\nsucceed the changes which the mean or ordinary \r\ntension of terrestrial magnetism undergoes. \r\nM de Humboldt considers that it deeply \r\ninterests the advancement of mathematical and \r\nphysical sciences that, under the auspices of \r\nH.R.H. the President, the Royal Society  should \r\nexert its influence in extending the line of simul-\r\ntaneous observations, and in establishing per-\r\nmanent magnetic stations in the tropical \r\nregions on both sides of the magnetic equator, \r\nin high southern latitudes and in Canada. He \r\nproposes this last station because the observations \r\nof horary variation in the vast extent of the \r\nUnited States are yet extremely rare.
