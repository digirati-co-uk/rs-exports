The length of the frontal from the sagittal \r\nsuture to the nasal bones, following the outer curve, is 5 inches (126 millims). There are no par- \r\ntial prominences answering to those specified as the \u2018frontal eminences \u2018 in \r\nmodern European skulls. The greatest breadth of the frontal, at the outer ends of \r\nthe \u2018coronal suture \u2018, is 4 1/4 inches (115 millims). A well-marked \u2018temporal ridge \u2018, <u>e<\\u>,\r\nextends from the \u2018external angular process \u2018, <u>f<\\u>, to the parietal, <u>b<\\u>. On the inner surface \r\nof the frontal the \u2018sulcus longitudinalis \u2018 is feebly and irregularly indicated, save \r\nwhere the \u2018inner table \u2018 begins to project before being continued into a strongly de-\r\nveloped \u2018frontal crest \u2018, which terminates at its forward subsidence in a small \r\n\u2018foramen caecum\u2018. The eminences and depressions of the \u2018inner table \u2018 <s>indicative <\\s> due to \r\n<s>of<\\s> cerebral convolutions are few & feebly indicated.\r\nThe Upper portions of the parietals are confluent along the sagittal suture, Plate III, which \r\nis, nevertheless, indicated on the outer surface: these bones, <u>b<\\u>, indicate by the transverse \r\ncurve a narrow cranium. The parietal foramen is present leading to the \r\nsuperior longitudinal sinus, at the hinder part of which are well-defined \u2018pacchio-\r\nnian depressions\u2019. Parts of the bone show a thickness of 10 millims.\r\nThe portion of occipital bone (Plate II, fig. 6) includes much of the right half of the lambdoidal \r\nsuture, with a strip of the deconnected parietal. The \u2018crista occipitalis \u2018, <u>r<\\u>, with both \r\nthe \u2018superior\u2019, <u>s<\\u>, and \u2018inferior <u>t<\\u> curved lines \u2018 or rather ridges, with their intervening spaces for \r\n\u2018complexi \u2018 and \u2018recti\u2019 capitis postici \u2018 muscles, are strongly marked; as is the \r\nbifurcation of the \u2018inferior curved line \u2018 denoting the space for the \u2018obliquus \r\nsuperior muscle \u2018 and the \u2018rectus capitis posticus major \u2018. On the inner surface of \r\nthe present cranial bone the \u2018fossae \u2018 for the hind lobe of the cerebrum and that \r\nfor the cerebellum are well-marked: but there is no depression answering to that \r\nnoted as the \u2018torcular Herophili \u2018 in modern European skulls which have been \r\nthe subjects of received anthropotomical descriptions.\r\nPar. The contraction and slope of the forehead and the prominence of the frontal \r\nsinuses are matched by Australian skulls: but I have not found in these so \r\ndefinite a channel between the prominences. The depression between the frontal \r\nand nasal bones is nearly the same; but the nasals are narrower in the Australian \r\nThese bones are anckylosed together in the position preserved in the present skull.\r\nPar. The notable specimen from the \u2018Neanderthal \u2018 consists of the skull-cap\r\nor ",
