Treated with soda-lime a large quantity of ammonia is given off. The \r\ndensity of the bone is 2.138, that of the recent tibia was found to be 1.985.\r\nTreated for twenty-two hours in the cold with the requisite amount of hydrochloric \r\nacid, of specific gravity 1.04, it was found that:-\r\nof these were dissolved 86.98\r\n[\u2026]ble organic matter -(Schewer\u2019s Kestron\u2019s osseine) 11.63\r\n[\u2026]able mineral matter, silica, &c. 1.39\r\n100.00\r\n[The] part dissolved consists of lime-phosphate, carbonate, &c. The insoluble \r\n[\u2026] removed by heating, 11.63 per cent. comes next that found by Fremy in fossil \r\nbones from the Oreston caves. He found in the external part of a metatarsal 10.3 per \r\n[cent] and in the internal part 11.0 per cent. Fremy also found in Rhinoceros-ribs from \r\n[\u2026], Gers, of silica and fluorides 1.4 per cent. I send you some of the \r\n[\u2026]ed bone.\u201d (Signed Walter Flight ).",
