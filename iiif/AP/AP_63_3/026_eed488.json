Further forwards than this \r\nthe definition of the crossed callosal fibres becomes \r\nmore & more indistinct <s>indefinite <\\s> on perpendicular sections.\r\nIn horizontal sections, however, it can be seen \r\nthat the same set of fibres arches <s>far<\\s> forwards \r\nfar in front of this. <s>end <\\s> The fibres come across <s>out of <\\s>\r\nthe corpus callosum from the opposite side & \r\nturn round to enter the <u>tractus medius <\\u> & <u>externus <\\u>;\r\nAnd these fibres wh: pursue this course are chiefly \r\nderived from the under surface of the frontal lobe.\r\nThey are seen <s>slan <\\s> in horizontal sections slanting \r\nforwards & upwards in the corpus callosum to \r\nreach the opposite side. They then arch forwards \r\ncurve outwards & backwards, &, as before said,\r\nenter the external & middle tracts. So that here \r\nalthough the fibres of the <u>crossed callosal tract <\\u> do not arch so highly up as \r\na little further back yet the same arrangement \r\nprevails, namely, that the fibres from the under \r\nsurface of the <s>opposite <\\s> frontal lobe of one side \r\ncross in the corpus callosum enter the <u>tractus \r\nmedius <\\u> & <u>externus <\\u>, & by them are conducted back \r\nas we shall see to the basal ganglia.\r\nI have already referred to certain obliquely cut \r\nfibres seen in the perpendicular <s>ly cut <\\s> section  ",
