Professor of \r\nPathological Anatomy (Sir Graeme Wilson Chair) Aberdeen University.\r\nCommunicated by the President R.S.\r\nReceived February 23.1884  Read February 28\r\n<u>Introductory <\\u>\r\nAt the present day it is almost universally \r\nsupposed that the corpus callosum of the human \r\nbrain is a commissure  between corresponding \r\nconvolutions of the two cerebral hemispheres.\r\nThus Meynert (Stricker\u2019s Histology. Syd. Soc.) one of \r\nthe greatest living authorities on the subject of the \r\nanatomico-physiological connections of the brain clearly \r\n<s>takes <\\s> holds by this opinion. <s>He h Frons <\\s> In the mic=\r\nroscopic examination of the brains of small animals \r\npossessing a corpus callosum he believes that he \r\nhas seen fibres running directly across from the \r\none side to the other, and he concludes that <s>therefore <\\s>\r\n<s>they have <\\s> the same arrangement prevails in Man.\r\n[This view is reiterated by Huguenin (Allgemeine \r\nPathologie der Krankheiten des Nervensystems 1.
