One great & primary conclusion \r\nof wh: I am myself thoroughly satisfied is that \r\nthe corpus callosum is not a commissure at \r\nall. The idea that bilateral action of the \r\ntwo hemispheres would be obtained by connecting \r\nthe convolutions of the two hemispheres directly \r\nis <s>it<\\s> I hold an erroneous physiological conclusion,\r\n& I question whether any such arrangement \r\nexists in the brain at all. The <u>anterior commissure <\\u>\r\nis I believe no more a commissure in the ordinary \r\nacceptation of the term than the corpus callosum \r\nis. So far as I know the whole of the cerebral \r\nsystemic fibres cross at some point in the cerebrospinal axis. <s>unless there \r\nthere <\\s> The motor fibres wh: have already crossed \r\nin the anterior pyramids <s>The latter <\\s> seem to run \r\nup directly to the motor area of the cortex.\r\nAll the other fibres of the cortex, however, cross in \r\nsome part of the brain pons or medulla or cord and \r\nthe destination of the majority of these fibres after \r\nthey have crossed is to become attached to a \r\nganglionic centre on the opposite side.",
