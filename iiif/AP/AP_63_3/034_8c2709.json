The inner mass is the \r\ndenser & thicker of the two, & consists of bundles \r\nrunning obliquely backwards. It is the \r\n<u>inner capsule <\\u>. The remainder of the <u>tractus\r\nexternus <\\u> is composed of a band of fibres running \r\nbackwards & downwards, and outside of, but in contact with it \r\nare certain interconvolutional fibres wh: are \r\nnow connected with the Island of Reil (Fig 3 f.f.)\r\nThe splitting of the <u>tractus externus <\\u> is brought \r\nabout by the interposition of a mass of grey \r\nmatter flat on the inside & convex <s>on the \r\noutside <\\s> externally (Fig 4). This grey mass is the first appearance of the <u>nucleus lenticularis <\\u>. A\r\nshort way further back the remainder of the \r\n<u>tractus externus <\\u> is separated from the interconvolutional \r\nfibres of the Island by a thin strip of grey matter.\r\nThis grey matter is the claustrum, & the <u>tractus \r\nexternus <\\u> being thus separated by it <s>from the interconvol-\r\nutional fibres of the Island <\\s> becomes the <u>outer \r\ncapsule <\\u>; while the interconvolutional fibres a \r\nlittle further back are transformed into the \r\n\u201cwhite substance of the Island of Reil \u201c.
