These are the \r\nfibres I have just described wh: coursing[?] from \r\nthe under surface of the frontal lobe of the op-\r\nposite side have crossed in the corpus callosum \r\nand are now arching backwards to join the \r\n<u>tractus medius <\\u> & <u>externus <\\u>. Further, what is\r\ndescribed by Meynert as the anterior peduncle \r\nof the thalamus (vorderer Stiel) is simply a large \r\nleash of these fibres. It is not derived, as \r\nMeynert supposes, from the frontal lobe of \r\nthe same side, but is simply part of the fibres \r\nwh: have crossed in the corpus callosum \r\nand have turned round in the <u>crossed callosal \r\ntract<\\u>, ultimately, to reach the thalamus \r\nopticus. Finally it may be said that the \r\nwhole of the fibres from the anterior extremity \r\nof the frontal lobe cross in the corpus callosum;\r\nthey are mixed up with those from the opposite \r\nside while within the corpus callosum, but \r\nwhen they have crossed they separate from \r\nthe latter turn backwards & (ultimately) <s>form in part <\\s>\r\nenter the inner & outer capsules. <s>By the <\\s> They do \r\nnot, however, enter the inner & outer capsules \r\ndirectly, but are distributed first to the <u>tractus<\\u>",
