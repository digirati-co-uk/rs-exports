In the <s>ne<\\s> brain \r\nof Man the <u>crossed callosal tract <\\u> comprising \r\nthe fibres from the one <s>opposite <\\s> side <s>of the human brain <\\s>\r\ncomes to lie in some parts within an eighth of \r\nof an inch of the cortex of the opposite side:\r\nin some places it is absolutely closer.
