The best means of demonstrating them,\r\nhowever, is simply in gross perpendicular segments \r\nof brain when hardened by my method. If such \r\na brain be cut into large slices half-an-inch\r\nthick & examined simply with the naked eye \r\nor with a pocket lens, they can be seen so\r\ndistinctly that I am surprised that they have \r\nnot been recognized before. I have looked through \r\nthe illustrations of sections of the brain given in \r\nthe works of Foville, Gratiolet, Reichert, Bourgery, &\r\nArnold & three of more recent writers, but in none of them can I find these\r\nfibres represented. In the fresh brain they are \r\nalmost invisible; in one hardened in spirit \r\nthey are a little better marked; but in a brain \r\ninjected with the mixture of Muller\u2019s fluid &\r\nspirit that I have recommended they are \r\nperfectly distinctly observed <s>visible marked <s>. Their locality & course \r\nare brought much better into view when the \r\nsurface is rendered quite flat by being planed \r\nin a freezing microtome such as I possess.\r\nViewed after these procedures they present the appear-\r\nance of a curved fibrous mass whose outer edge is \r\nperfectly differentiated and approaches close to \r\nthe grey matter of the frontal cortex & while throughout the \r\ngreater part of their course internally they\r\n<s>internally <\\s> sweep round <s>intern <\\s>\r\nthe basal ganglia. They are represented in Figures 3, 4, 5, & 6.",
