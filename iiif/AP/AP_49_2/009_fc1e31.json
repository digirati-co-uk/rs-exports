Herald enable<s>s<\\s> us to realize the size of the \r\nanimal. They are taken in inches & tenths. The weight of the Males \r\nkilled on that island exceeded 700 pounds, of which 400 was meat, \"and \r\nthey stood 10[half] hands high at the withers or 42 inches\". \r\nMusk Musk Musk Musk \r\nBull Cow Cow Cow \r\nFrom Horns to the root of tail 86.0 70.5 64.0 62.0 \r\nFrom the fore <s>of<\\s> hoof to the top of the shoulder 57.0 55.0 - 49.5 \r\nFrom the hind hoof to the top of the rump 51.0 - - - \r\nLength of tail 2.0 \r\nLength of one horn 27.0 24.0 - 19.0 \r\nFrom the tip of one horn to that of the other 32.0 27.3  27.5. \r\nIn this brief r[e acute]sume of the external characters of Ovibos \r\nthe truth of M. de Blainville's views as to its place in \r\nthe scale between Ovis <s>and Capra<\\s>  on the one hand and \r\nBos on the other is most amply proved. In addition \r\nto the absence of a muffle and of a dewlap on which his \r\nclassification is principally based, the hairiness of its \r\nnostrils, the shortness of its tail, the want of symmetry \r\nin its hoofs, differentiate it from all the Oxen, Bisons \r\nand Buffaloes, and especially from Bubalus Caffir, which \r\nit resembles superficially, in the large size and downward \r\ndirection of the horns and the close approximation of their \r\nbases in the adult males. In these points also it has a \r\nstill closer resemblance to the Gnu or Wildebeest of the \r\nCape, as well as in the long hair on its chin, and neck, and \r\nthe e<s>r<\\s>rect hair between its shoulders while its smallness \r\nof ear shortness of tail and want of symmetry in its \r\nhoofs are among the differences. \r\n",
