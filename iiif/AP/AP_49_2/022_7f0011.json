They consist of <s>7<\\s> seven cervicals, <s>13<\\s> thirteen dorsals \r\nsix lumbars, six sacrals, and six caudals. \r\n<u>Scapula<\\u>. The scapula in common with that of Ovis differs from \r\nthat of ox in the straightness of its spine, in the curvature \r\nof the dorsal edge, & the small size of the acrom<s>a<\\s>ion, <s>the humer<\\s> \r\n<u>Humerus<\\u>. The humerus presents the following characteristics \r\nthe deltoid ridge is smaller and less everted the superior \r\ntuberosity is more massive and the ridge running \r\nfrom the deltoid to the outer side of the proximal articulation \r\nis less marked than in the corresponding ox bone, the \r\nbone itself is also more slender \r\n<u>Radius<\\u>. The radius presents the following differences from \r\nthat of Bos, the tuberosity on the exterior on the proximal \r\nend is further removed from the articulation and the \r\nbone itself is smoother and rounder, the muscular \r\nimpressions are not so strongly marked. \r\n<u>Ulna<\\u>. The superior surface of the olecranon is rounded \r\nand is much stouter than in Bos or Bison in which \r\nit ends in a sharp ridge, the transverse diameter \r\nof the proximal articulation is also greater, the groove \r\nat the point of anchylosis with the radius is also absent,  \r\nall these are ovine characters. \r\nMetacarpal - the metacarpal is shorter and stouter than that \r\nof ox its <s>superior<\\s> dorsal surface bears the merest trace \r\nof an adductor groove.
