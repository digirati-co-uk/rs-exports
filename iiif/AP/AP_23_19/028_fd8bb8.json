There is not much danger \r\nof this, provided both are perfectly dry.\r\nIt may be well to mention however, that in case \r\nany stain should be perceived on the engraving \r\nit may be readily removed by a chemical application \r\nwhich does no injury whatever to the paper.\r\nIn copying engravings &c. by this method, \r\nthe light & shadows are reversed: consequently the \r\neffect is wholly altered. But if the picture \r\nso obtained is first <u>preserved <\\u> so as to bear \r\nsunshine, it may be afterwards itself employed \r\nas an object to be copied: & by means of this \r\nsecond process the lights & shadows are brought \r\nback to their original disposition.
