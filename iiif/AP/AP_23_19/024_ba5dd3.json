An hour or two afterwards \r\nI opened the box, & I found depicted upon the \r\npaper a very distinct representation of the \r\nbuilding, with the exception of those parts of it \r\nwhich lay in the shade.\r\nA little experience in this branch of the art \r\nshowed me, that with smaller <u>camerae obscurae <\\u>\r\nthe effect would be produced in a smaller time.\r\nAccordingly I had several small boxes made,\r\nin which I fixed lenses of shorter focus, & with \r\nthese I obtained very perfect but extremely small \r\npictures: such as without great stretch of imagination \r\nmight be supposed to be the work of some \r\nLilliputian artist. They require indeed \r\nexamination with a lens, to discern all their \r\nminutiae.",
