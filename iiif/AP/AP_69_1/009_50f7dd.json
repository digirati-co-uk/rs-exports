I found \r\nto my surprise, <s>that <\\s> when a thin section of the leaf, including \r\na portion of the ring, was placed under the microscope, that \r\nit consisted of a layer of cells, filled with a ruby red colouring \r\nmatter. The dark colour first seen was due no doubt to the density \r\nof the leaf being so great as not to permit the light to pass ",
