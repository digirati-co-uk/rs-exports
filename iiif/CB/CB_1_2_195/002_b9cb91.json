I The Sines of Inflection and deflection have each of them \r\na given ratio to the sine of incidence.\r\nII. The angle of <u>Inflection <\\u> is <u>equal <\\u> to the angle of <u>deflection <\\u>\r\nIII. Rays which differ in Refrangibility differ also in In \r\nflexibility & deflexibility; the most refrangible, being least \r\nInflexible and deflexible .\r\nIV. Rays which differ in refrangibility, differ also in re \r\nflexibility ; the most refrangible being least reflexible \r\nV. The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence \r\n<u>only <\\u> in the mean rays: in the red it is less, & in the violet <u>greater <\\u>\r\nVI. The spectra by reflection, inflection, & deflection, are \r\ndivided exactly in the harmonical way, like that by <u>refraction <\\u>\r\nVII. The relative sizes of the parts of light, are found by calculation \r\nVIII. The colours of Bodies depend on the different reflexibility \r\nof the rays, the position of their particles, & the magni \r\ntude of these, in so far as this affects the position \r\nHoping you will excuse the trouble I have given you, & accept \r\nof my sincere thanks for your kindness I remain &c\r\nH.B.",
