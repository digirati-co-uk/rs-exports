The blew wch Succeeded \r\nbecame very good & of a fair bright Sky colour; but yet Some \r\nthing inferiour to the former blew. And the violet was \r\nintense & deep with little or no Redness in it, And less in\r\nquantity then the Blew.\r\nIn the last Red appeared a Tincture of Scarlet next \r\nthe Violet, wch Soon changed to a brighter colour inclineing to a \r\nOrange, And the yellow wch followed was at first pretty good \r\n& lively, but afterwards it grew more & more dilute, untill \r\nby degrees it ended in p[er]fect whitenesse. And this whitenes[se?]\r\nif the water was very tenacious & well tempered; would slow[ly]\r\nspread & dilate it Self over the greatest part of the Bubble \r\ncontinually growing paler at the top, where at length it would \r\ncrack in many places, & those cracks as they dilated would appe[ar]\r\nof a pretty good, but yet obscure & dark Sky colour, the white \r\nbetween the blew spots diminishing untill it resembled the [text?]\r\nof an irregular Nettworke & soon after vanished & left all the \r\nupper part of the Bubble of the said dark blew colour. And [the?]\r\ncolour after the aforesaid manner dilated it Selfe downwards \r\nuntill Somtimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the \r\nmean while at the topp, wch was of a darker Blew then the \r\nbottome & appeared also of many round blew Spots Something \r\ndarker then the rest, there would Emerge one or more very \r\nblack Spots, & within those, other Spots of an Intenser black[nes?]\r\nwch I menc[i]oned in the former observac[i]on; And those continually \r\ndilated themselves untill the Bubble broak.\r\nIf the water was not very tenacious, the black Spots would \r\nbreak forth in the white without any Sensible Intervenc[i]on of \r\nthe blew: And Somtimes they would break forth within the \r\nprecedent Yellow, or Red, or p[er]haps within the Blew of the 2d\r\nOrder before the intermediate colours had time to display \r\nthemselues.\r\nBy this description you may p[er]ceive, how great an affinity \r\nthese colours haue with those of Air described in the fourth \r\nObservac[i]on, although Sett downe in a contrary Order by reason \r\nthat they begin to appear when the Bubble is thickest & are \r\nmost conveniently reckoned from the lowest & thickest part\r\nof the Bubble upwards\r\nObs: 19.
