For the opakest bodyes, if their parts \r\nbe Subtily divided (as Mettalls by being dissolued in acid \r\nMenstruums, &c) become p[er]fectly transparent And you \r\nmay also remember, that in the 8th Observac[i]on there was \r\nno reflexion at the Superficies of the Object-Glasses \r\nwhere they were very near one another though they did \r\nnot absolutely touch. <s>And in the 17th Observac[i]on the \r\nreflexion of the water-bubble, where they were very near \r\none another though they did not absolutely touch <\\s> And \r\nin the 17th Observac[i]on the reflexion of the water-bubble \r\nwhere it became thinnest, was almost insensible So as to \r\ncause the Apparac[i]ons of very black Spots.\r\nOn these grounds I conceive it is, that water, Salt,\r\nGlasse, Stones, & Such like Substances, are transparent. For,\r\nupon divers Considerac[i]ons they Seeme to be as porous as other \r\nbodyes, but yet their pores & parts too small to cause any \r\nOpacity.\r\nProp: 5 The Transparent parts of bodyes according \r\nto their Seu[er]all Sizes must <u>reflect <\\u> rayes of one colour, and \r\n<u>transmitt <\\u> those of another, on the Same Grounds, that thinn \r\nplates or Bubbles doe reflect or transmitt those rayes.\r\nAnd this I take to be the ground of all their Colours.\r\nFor if a thinn\u2019d or plated body, wch being of an even \r\nthicknesse appears all ouer of one uniforme colour, Should \r\nbe broken into Fragments of the same thickness with the \r\nplate, I See no reason why a heap of those fragments should \r\nnot constitute a powder of the same colour which the Plate \r\nexhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall \r\nbodies, being like So many fragments of a Plate must on the \r\nSame grounds exhibit the Same colours.\r\nNow ",
