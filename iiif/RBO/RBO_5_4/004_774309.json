In the \r\nthird Columne the diameter of any coloured Ring of those Obliquities \r\nis exprest in parte of wch. ten constitute that diameter when the Rayes \r\nare perpendicular. And in the fourth Columne the thicknes of the \r\nair at the circumference of that Ring is exprest in parte of which also \r\ntenn constitute that thicknes when the rayes are perpendicular.\r\nObs: 8. The dark spot in the midle of the Rings increased \r\nalso by that Obliquac[i]on of the eye, although almost insensibly. But if \r\ninstead of the Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase \r\nwas more manifest when viewed so obliquely, that no colours appeared \r\nabout it. It was least when the rayes were incident most obliquely \r\non the interjacent Air, and increased more and more, untill the \r\ncoloured Rings appeared, & then decreased againe but not so much \r\nas it increased before. And hence it is evident, that the transparency \r\nwas not onely at the absolute contact of the glasses, but also where \r\nthey had some little intervall. I haue sometimes observed the \r\nDiameter of that Spot to be between halfe and two fift parts of \r\nthe diameter of the exteriour circumference of the Red in the \r\nfirst circuit or revolution of colours when viewed almost p[er]pendicu-\r\n-larly, whereas when viewed obliquely, it hath wholly vanished &\r\nbecome opake & white like the other parts of the Glasse: whence \r\nit may be collected, that the glasses did then scarsely or not at all \r\ntouch ",
