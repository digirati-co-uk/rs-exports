To doe wch, let there be described a large Arc of a \r\nCircle and a Streight Line, wch may touch that Arc, and \r\nparalell to that Tangent Seu[er]all occult Lines at such \r\ndistances from it as the numbers, sett against the seu[er]all \r\ncolours in the Table, Denote. For the Arc & its Tangent \r\nwill represent the superficies of the Glasses terminating the \r\ninterjacent Air, & the places where the occult lines cutt ye \r\nArc will show at what distances from the Center or point of \r\nContact each colour is reflected.\r\nThere are alsoe other uses of this Table. For by its \r\nAssistance the thicknes of the Bubble in the 19th Observac[i]on \r\nwas determined by the colours wch it exhibited. And so the \r\nbignesse of the partes of naturall Bodyes may be conjectured \r\nat by their colours, as shall be hereafter showne. Also if two \r\nor more very thin plates be layd one upon another so as to \r\ncompose one plate, equalling them all in thickness, the \r\nresulting colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr.\r\nHook in his Micrographia observes, that a faint yellow plate \r\nof Moscovy Glasse, laid upon a blew one, constituted a very deep \r\npurple. The yellow of the first Order is a faint one and the \r\nthicknes of the plate Exhibiting it, according to the Table,\r\nis 5 1/4, to wch add 9 1/2 the thicknesse exhibiting Blew of the \r\nSecond Order, & the Summe will be 14 3/4, wch most nearly \r\napproaches 14 4/5 the thicknesse exhibiting the Purple of \r\nthe third Order\r\nTo explaine in the next place the circumstances of the \r\nSecond & 3d Observac[i]ons, that is, how the colours (by \r\nturning the Prisms about their comon Axis the contrary \r\nway to that expressed in those Observac[i]ons) may be converted \r\ninto ",
