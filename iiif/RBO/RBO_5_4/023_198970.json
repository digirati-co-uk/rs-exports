And by the 13th \r\n14th & 15th Observac[i]ons compared with the 4th or 18th, there \r\nappears to be the Same constant Relac[i]on between colour \r\n& Reflexibi<s>l<\\s>lity; the violet being on equall termes reflected \r\nat least thicknesse of any thin plate or Bubble, the Red \r\nat greatest thicknesse, and the intermediate colours at intermediate \r\nthicknesses: whence it followes, that the colorifique disposic[i]ons \r\nof Rayes are alsoe connate with them & im[m]utable, and by \r\nconsequence, that all the productions & appearances of \r\ncolour<s>es<\\s>s in the world are derived not from any Physicall \r\nchange caused in light by refraction or reflexion, but onely \r\nf[ro]m the various mixtures or Separations of rayes by \r\nvirtue of their different Refrangibi<s>l<\\s>lity or Reflexibility \r\nAnd in this respect it is, that the Science of colours \r\nbecomes a Speculac[i]on more proper for Mathematicians \r\nthen Naturalists.\r\nI am ",
