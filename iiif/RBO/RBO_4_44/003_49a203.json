                "chars": "The gradual removal of these Suspitions at length led me to the \r\nExperimentum Crucis which was this, I took two boards and placed one \r\nof them close behind the Prisme at the window soe that the light might \r\npasse through a smal <s>w<\\s>hole made in it for the pupose and fall on the \r\nother board which I placed at about 12 feet distance haueing first made a \r\nsmal hole in it also for some of that incident light to passe through, Then \r\nI placed another Prisme behind this second board so that the light trajected \r\nthrough both the boards might pass through that also, and be againe \r\nrefracted before it arrived at the wall This done I took the first Prisme \r\nin my hand and turned it to and fro: slowly about its Axis soe much \r\nas to make the severall parts of the Image cast on the second board \r\nSuccessively pass: through the hole in it that I might observe to what \r\nplaces on the wall the Second prisme would refract them and I saw by \r\nthe variation of those places that the light tending to that end of the \r\nImage, towards which the refraction of the first prisme was made did in \r\nthe second Prisme suffer a refraction considerably greater then ye light \r\ntending to the other end, And soe the true cause of the length of yt Image \r\nwas detected to be no other then that light consists of Rays differently \r\nrefrangable wch without any respect to a difference in their incidence, were \r\naccording to their degrees of refrangibility transmited towards divers parts \r\nof the wall \r\nWhen I understood this I left off my aforesaid glasse workes for I saw \r\nthat the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited not so much for want \r\nof glasses truely figured according to ye prescription of Optick Authors \r\n(which all men haue heitherto imagined) as because that light it selfe is a \r\nHeterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible Rays. Soe that were a glasse \r\nsoe exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rays into one point it could not \r\ncollect those alsoe into the same point which haueing the same incidence upon \r\nthe same medium are apt to Suffer a different refraction Nay I wonder that \r\nseeing the difference of refrangibility was soe great as I found it, Telescopes \r\nshould arrive to that perfection they are now at For measureing the refraction \r\nin one of my prismes I found yt suposeing the comon sine of incidence upon \r\none of its planes was 44 parts the sine of refraction of the utmost Rays on \r\nthe red end of the colours, made out of the glasse into the Air would be 68 parts \r\nand the sine of refraction of the utmost Rays on the other end 69 parts soe \r\nthat the difference is about a 24th or 25th part of the whole refraction And \r\nconsequently the object glasse of my Telescope cannot collect all ye Rays which \r\ncome frome one point of an object soe as to make them convene at its focus in \r\nlesse roome then in a cir[c]ular space whose diameter is ye 50th part of ye Diameter \r\nof its Aperture wch is an Iregularity some hundred of times greater then a \r\ncircularly figured Lens of soe small a Section as ye object glasses of long Telescopes \r\nare would cause by the unfitnes of its figure, were Light uniforme \r\nThis ",
