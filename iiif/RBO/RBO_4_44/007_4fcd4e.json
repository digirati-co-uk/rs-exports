And for ye same reason it is yt objects when looked upon \r\nthrough a prisme appeare coloured, for the deforme Rays by their unequal \r\nrefractions are made to diverge towards severall parts of the Retina and \r\ntheire expresse the Images of thing coloured as in the former case they did the \r\nSuns Image upon a wall And by this inequallity of refractions they become \r\nnot onely coloured by alsoe very confused and indistinct \r\n10 Why the Colours of the Rainbow appeare in falling drops of Raine \r\nis alsoe from hence evident, For those drops which refract the Rays \r\ndisposed to appeare purple in greatest quantity to the Spectators eye \r\nrefract the Rays of other sorts soe much lesse as to make them passe \r\nbeside it and such are the drops on the inside of the Primary bow and on \r\nthe outside of the secondary or exteriour one, Soe those dropes wch refract in \r\ngreatest plenty the Rays apt to appeare Red towards the Spectators eye \r\nrefract those of other sorts soe much more as to make them passe beside it \r\nand such are the drops on ye exteriour parts of ye primary and interiour \r\nparts of ye secondary bow \r\n11 The odd Phaenomena of an infusion of Lignu[m] Nephriticum Leafe \r\ngould fragments of coloured glasse and some other transparent coloured bodies \r\nappeareing in one position of one colour and of another in an other are on these \r\ngrounds noe longer riddles For those are Substances apt to reflect one sort of light \r\nand transmit another as may be seene in a darke roome by illuminateing them \r\nwith similar or compounded light. For then they appeare of that colour onely \r\nwth which they are illuminated but yet in one position more vivid & luminous \r\nthen another according as they are disposed more or lesse to reflect or transmit \r\nthe incident colours \r\n12 From whence also is manifest the Reason of an unexpected experiment \r\nwhich Mr Hooke somewhere in his Micrography relates to haue made with two \r\nwedges like transparent vessell fill\u2019d the one with a Red the other with a blew \r\nliquor namely that though thay they were severally transparent enough yet both \r\ntogether became Opake For if one transmitted onely red and ye other onely blew \r\nnoe Rays could passe through both \r\n13 I might add more instances of this nature but I shall conclude wth this \r\ngenerall one yt the colours of all naturall bodies haue no other Origin then this \r\nthat they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in great plenty then \r\nanother And this I have experimented in a darke roome by illuminateing those \r\nbodies wth uncompounded light of divers colours For by that meanes any body \r\nmay be made to appeare of any colour They haue there noe appropriate colour \r\nbut ever appeare of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet wth this difference \r\nthat they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their owne day light colour \r\nMinium appeareth there of any colour indifferently wth wch tis illustrated, but \r\nyet most luminous in red and so wise appeareth indifferently of any colour wth \r\nwhich tis illustrated but yet most luminous in blew and therefore Minium \r\nreflecteth rays of any colour but most copiously those indued with red, and \r\nconsequently when illustrated with day light that is with all sorts of rays \r\npromiscuously blended those qualified with red shall abound most in the \r\nreflected light and by their prevalence cause it to appeare of that colour \r\nand \r\n",
