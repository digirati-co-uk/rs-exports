I understood that by their mediation Opticke \r\ninstruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable \r\nprovided a Reflecting substance could be found, which I would polish \r\nas finely as glass and reflect as much light as glass transmits and the \r\nart of com[m]unicating to it a parabolick figure be also attained But \r\nthere seemed very great difficulties and I haue almost thought them \r\nInsuperable, when I further considered that every irregularity in a \r\nReflecting superficies makes the Rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of \r\ntheir due course then the like irregularities in a reflecting [refracting?] one Soe yt a\r\nmuch greater curiosity would be here requisite then in figureing glasses \r\nfor refraction \r\nAmidst these thought I was forced from Cambridge by ye Intervening \r\nPlague, and it was more then two yeares before I proceeded further \r\nBut then haueing thought on a tender way of polishing proper for \r\nmetall where by as I imagined the figure alsoe would be corrected to the \r\nlast I began to try what might be effected in this kind and by degrees \r\nso farr perfected an Instrument (in the essential parts of it like that \r\nI sent to London) by which I could descern Iupiters 4 concomitants, and \r\nshowed them divers times to two of my acquantances I could alsoe \r\ndiscerne the Moon=like phase of Venus but not very distinctly nor \r\nwithout some nicenesse in disposeing the Instrument \r\nFrom that time I was interrupted till this Autumn when I made \r\nthe other, And as at that was sensible better then the first (especially for \r\nDay=Objects) so I doubt not but they will be still brought to a much \r\ngreater perfection by their endeavours who as you informe me are \r\ntakeing care about it at London \r\nI haue thought sometimes to make a Microscope wch in like manner \r\nwould haue insted of an object glasse, a Reflecting peice of metall \r\nAnd this I hope they will also take into considerac[i]on for those Instru=\r\nments seeme as capable of improuement as Telescopes & perhaps more because \r\nbut one reflective peice of metall is requisite in them as you may \r\nperceive by the annexed diagram where AB representeth the \r\nobject metall CD\r\nthe eye glass F their \r\ncommon Focus and \r\nO the other Focus \r\nof the metall in \r\nwhich the object \r\nis placed\r\nBut to returne from this digression I told you that light is not \r\nsimilar or homogeneal but consists of difforme Rays some of wch are more \r\nrefrangable then others So that of those which are a like incident on \r\nthe same Medium some shall be more refracted then others and that not \r\nby",
