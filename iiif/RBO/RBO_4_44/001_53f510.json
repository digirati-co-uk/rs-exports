I could Scarse thinke that \r\nthe various thicknes of the glasse, or the termination with \r\nshadow or darknes could have any influence on light to produce \r\nsuch an effect; yet I thought it not amisse, first to examine \r\nthose circumstances and soe tryed what would happen by \r\ntransmiting <s>[text?]<\\s> light through parts of the glass of \r\ndivers thicknesses, or through holes in ye window of divers bignesses \r\nor by setting the Prisme without soe that the light might pass through \r\nit, and be refracted before it was terminated by the hole: But I found none \r\nof those circumstances materiall, The fashion of the Colours was in all these \r\ncases the same \r\nThen I suspected whether by any unevennese in ye glass or other contingent \r\nirregularity, these colours might be thus dilated, And to try this I tooke \r\nanother prisme like the former and soe p<s>as<\\s>laced it that ye light passing through \r\nthem both might be refracted contrary ways and soe by the latter returnd \r\ninto that course from which the former had diverted it. For by this meanes \r\nI thought the regular effects of the first prisme would be destroyed by ye \r\nsecond Prisme, but the irregular ones more augmented by the multiplicity \r\nof refractions. The event was that the Light which by the first Prisme was \r\ndiffused into an oblong forme was by the second was reduced into an Orbicular \r\none with as much regularity, as when it did not at all pass through them So \r\nthat what ever was the cause of that length twas not any contingent \r\nirregularity.\r\nI then proceed to examine more critically, what might be effected by the \r\ndifferance of the incidence of Rays comeing from divers parts of the Sun \r\nand to that end measured the several lynes and angles belonging to the \r\nImage, its distance from the <s>w<\\s>hole or Prisme was 22 foot its utmost \r\nlength 13 1/4 inches its breadth 2 1/8 the diameter of the hole 1/4 of an inch \r\nthe Angle wth ye Rays tending towards the midle of the Image made with \r\nthose lynes in which they would haue proceeded without refraction was 44 \r\ndegrees 56 1/2 And the vertical Angle of the Prisme 63 degr 12 Alsoe the \r\nrefractions both sides the Prisme, that is, of the incident & emergent \r\nRays, where as neere as I could make them equal and consequently about \r\n54 deg: 4 And the Rays fell perpendicularly upon the wall Now Subduc=\r\n=ting the diameter of the hole from the Length and breadth of the \r\nImage, there remaines 13 Inches the Length, and 2 3/8 the breadth \r\ncomprehending by those Rays which passed through the center of the \r\nsaid hole and consequently the Angle of the <s>\r\nw<\\s>hole wch that  breadth \r\nsubtended was about 31: Answereable to the Suns diameter but the Angle,\r\nwhich its Length subtended, was more then five such Diameters namely \r\nhaueing ",
