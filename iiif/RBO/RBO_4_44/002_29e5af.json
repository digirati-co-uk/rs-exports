By this experim[en]t \r\ntherefore, as well as by the former computac[i]on it was evident that the \r\ndifferance of the incidence of Rays, flowing from divers parts of the \r\nSun could not make them after decussation diverge at a Sensible greater \r\nAngle then that at which they before converged which being at most \r\nbut about 31 or 32 minuts there stile remained some other cause to \r\nbe found out, from whence it could be 2 deg 49\r\nThen I began to Suspect whether the Rays after their trajection \r\nthrough the Prisme, did not move in curved lines and according to their \r\nmore or less curvity tend to divers parts of the wall, And it increased \r\nmy Suspition, when I remembred I had often seen a Tennis ball \r\nstruck with an oblique Racket, describe such a curve line For a circular \r\nas well as a progressive motion being comunicated to it by yt stroake,\r\nits parts on that side where the motions conspire, must presse and \r\nbeat the contiguous Aire more violent then on the other, and their \r\nexcite a reluctancy and reaction of the Aire proportionably greater: \r\nAnd for the same reason if the Rays of light should possibly be globular \r\nbodies and by their oblique passage out of one medium into another \r\nacquire a circulating motion, they out to feel the greater resistance from \r\nthe ambient AEther, on that side where the motion conspire and thence \r\nbe continually bowed to the other  But notwithstanding these plau=\r\nsable grounds of suspition when I came to examine it I could observe \r\nnoe such curvity in them And besids (wch was enough for my purpose) I \r\nobserved that the difference twixt the lenght of the Image and \r\ndiameter of the <s>w<\\s>hole through which the light was transmitted was \r\nproportionable to their distance \r\nThe ",
