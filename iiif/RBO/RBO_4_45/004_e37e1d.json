He that shall but a little consider the\r\nundulations on the surface of a small River of water in\r\na gutter or the like will easily see the whole manner curiously\r\nexemplified\r\n\r\nThe eighth proposition I cannot at all assent to for the\r\nreasons above and the reasons of the blen flame of\r\nBrimstone of the yellow of a candle, the green of Copper\r\nand the various colours of the Starrs and other Luminous\r\nbodies. I take to proceed from quite another cause easily\r\nexplained by my former hypothesis\r\n\r\nI agree with the observations of the Ninth Tenth and\r\nEleaventh though not with his Theory as finding it not\r\nabsolutly necessary, being as easily and naturally eplained\r\nand solved by my Hypothesis\r\n\r\nThe reasons of the Phegnomana of my experiment which he\r\nalleadheth is as easily solvable by my Hypothesis as by his, as\r\nare alsoe those which are which are mencioned in the thirteenth I doe\r\nnot therefore se any absolute necessity to beleive his Theory\r\ndemonstrated since I can assure M Newton I cannot onely\r\nsolve all the Phenomena of light and colours by the hypothesis I \r\nhave formerly printed and now explicate them by, but by two or\r\nthree other very differing from it & from this which he hath\r\ndescribed in his ingenious discours\r\n\r\nNor would I be understood to have said all this against his\r\nTheory as it is an hypothesis for I doe most readily agree with\r\nthem in every part thereof and esteeme it very subtile and\r\ningenious and capable of solveing all the Phenomena of colours\r\nbut I cannot thinke it to be the onely hypothesis nor soe\r\ncertaine as Mathematicall Demonstrations\r\n\r\nBut grant his first proposition, that Light is a body and\r\nthat as many colours as degrees thereof as there may be, soe many\r\nsorts of bodys there may be all which compounded together would\r\nmake white",
